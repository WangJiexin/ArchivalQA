The 40-year-old Mr. Murakami is a publishing sensation in Japan .
A more recent novel , `` Norwegian Wood '' -LRB- every Japanese under 40 seems to be fluent in Beatles lyrics -RRB- , has sold more than four million copies since Kodansha published it in 1987 .
Some of his observations about Japanese management style are on the mark .
It 's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity , that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager , and that Sony was chary of letting a young , short-term American employee take on any responsibility .
But it is Mr. Lane , as movie director , producer and writer , who has been obsessed with refitting Chaplin 's Little Tramp in a contemporary way .
In 1976 , as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York , Mr. Lane shot `` A Place in Time , '' a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist , a man of the streets .

California 's education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at 40 schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test .
Mrs. Ward resolved to clean out `` deadwood '' in the school 's faculty and restore safety , and she also had some new factors working in her behalf .
One was statewide school reform , which raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment .
`` She just never gave it up , '' says Mary Marchand , Mary Beth 's mother .
`` You 'd see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game . ''
To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities -- and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests -- Mrs . Yeargin won widespread local support .

He contends that the perception in Japan of a vitriolic U.S. response to Sony Corp. 's announcement of its purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. has been temporarily mollified .
He cites the recent deal between the Mitsubishi Estate Co. and the Rockefeller Group , as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed Japanese company in the Georgia-Pacific Corp. takeover bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. as evidence .

The Japanese fret openly about the U.S. public 's rancor .
One clear sign of Japan 's nervousness came this week , when a spokesman for Japan 's Foreign Ministry devoted nearly all of a regular , half-hour briefing for foreign journalists to the subject of recent Japanese investments in the U.S. .
Heightened Japanese interest in American small business parallels an acceleration of investments giving Japanese companies control of large , highly visible U.S. corporations , such as Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc .
Only this week , it was announced that Mitsubishi Estate Co. had acquired a 51 % stake in Rockefeller Group , which owns New York 's prestigious Rockefeller Center .

History , after all , is not on his side .
According to a nationwide survey taken a year ago , nearly a third of England 's church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them .
It is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes .
The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells , as do the carillons of continental Europe , is considered by the English to be childish , fit only for foreigners .
With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling , strong-willed vicars are pressing equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services .
Two years ago , the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone , vicar of Great Torrington , Devon , got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he sacked the entire band ; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest .
The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers , a sort of parliament of ringing groups , aims to improve relations with vicars , says John C. Baldwin , president .
It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled , `` The Bells in Your Care . ''
They are n't accepted everywhere , however .
The oldest bell-ringing group in the country , the Ancient Society of College Youths , founded in 1637 , remains male-only , a fact that 's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain 's most prestigious churches , St. Paul 's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey .
This being Britain , no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to `` The Ringing World , '' a weekly newspaper for ringers .
One writer , signing his letter as `` Red-blooded , balanced male , '' remarked on the `` frequency of women fainting in peals , '' and suggested that they `` settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings . ''
That pattern has n't always held , but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious .
Payouts on the S&P 500 stocks rose 10 % in 1988 , according to Standard & Poor 's Corp. , and Wall Street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9 % and 14 % .
One indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from Standard & Poor 's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends .
A total of 139 companies raised dividends in October , basically unchanged from 138 a year ago , S&P said Wednesday .
In any case , opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels .
Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a 12 % to 15 % total return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12 months -- vs. a `` cash rate of return '' of perhaps 7 % or 8 % if dividend growth is weak .

Tokyo 's leading program traders are the big U.S. securities houses , though the Japanese are playing catch-up .
Some U.S. firms , notably Salomon Inc. and Morgan Stanley Group Inc. , have reaped a hefty chunk of their Japanese earnings from index arbitrage , both for customers and for their own accounts .
The British also are scrutinizing program trades .
Index-arbitrage trading is `` something we want to watch closely , '' an official at London 's Stock Exchange said .
So far , Mr. Hahn is trying to entice Nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough .
`` We are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction , '' he says .
But he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand .
In 1970 , Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building .
But Mr. Hahn rose swiftly through the ranks , demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on .
The son of a physicist , Mr. Hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates .

You did not note that the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse .

Publishing officials believe that while Random House has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years , some of the bigger ones have n't been absorbed so easily .
Crown Publishing Group , acquired last year , is said to be turning in disappointing results .
Speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house .
Possible candidates include Susan Petersen , president of Ballantine\/Del Rey\/Fawcett , Random House 's huge and successful paperback division .
President Reagan learned that lesson .
By 1987 , then-Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II .
An attempted buy-out led by John J. McCabe , chief operating officer , never materialized , and a stream of what one staff member dismissed as `` tire-kickers and lookee-loos '' had filed through since .
The prospective buyers included investor Marvin Davis and the Toronto Sun .
Further , the Herald seemed torn editorially between keeping its old-time Hearst readership -- blue-collar and sports-oriented -- and trying to provide a sprightly , upscale alternative to the sometimes staid Times .
Hearst had flirted with a conversion to tabloid format for years but never executed the plan .
Many felt Hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did , if marginally , because of its place in family history .
Its fanciful offices were designed by architect Julia Morgan , who built the Hearst castle at San Simeon .
Financially , it never recovered ; editorially , it had its moments .
In 1979 , Hearst hired editor James Bellows , who brightened the editorial product considerably .
The reaction in the newsroom was emotional .
`` I 've never seen so many people crying in one place at one time , '' said Bill Johnson , an assistant city editor .
The Old Guard 's assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based , in part because some Old Guard members feel their very livelihood is at stake .
Some , such as traditional money manager Neuberger & Berman , have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators `` stop the numbers racket on Wall Street . ''
Even some members of the Old Guard , despite their current advantage , seem to be conceding that the future belongs with the New Guard .
Last week , Robert M. Bradley , one of the Big Board 's most respected floor traders and head of a major traders ' organization , surrendered .
The battle has turned into a civil war at some firms and organizations , causing internal contradictions and pitting employee against employee .
At Kidder , a unit of General Electric Co. , and other big brokerage firms , stockbrokers battle their own firm 's program traders a few floors away .
The program traders , on the other hand , portray old-fashioned stock pickers as the Neanderthals of the industry .
Critics like Mr. Murray `` are looking for witches , and people who use computers to trade are a convenient boogieman , '' says J. Thomas Allen , president of Advanced Investment Management Inc. , a Pittsburgh firm that runs a $ 200 million fund that uses index arbitrage .
But many experts and traders say that program trading is n't the main reason for stock-market gyrations .
`` I have not seen one iota of evidence '' to support restrictions on program trading , says a Vanderbilt University finance professor , Hans Stoll , an authority on the subject .
Susan Del Signore , head trader at Travelers Investment Management Co. , says critics are ignoring `` the role the -LCB- takeover stock -RCB- speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility . ''
Many arbs are `` overleveraged , '' she says , and they `` have to sell when things look like they fall apart . ''
Stockbrokers ' business and pay has been falling .
Last year , the average broker earned $ 71,309 , 24 % lower than in 1987 .
Index traders who buy all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 often do n't even know what the companies they own actually do , complains Andrew Sigler , chairman of Champion International Corp .
`` Do you make sweatshirts or sparkplugs ?
Oh , you 're in the paper business , '' is one reaction Mr. Sigler says he 's gotten from his big institutional shareholders .
The anti-programmers are getting some helpful thunder from Congress .
Program traders ' `` power to create total panic is so great that they ca n't be allowed to have their way , '' says Rep. Edward Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat .
Another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an `` uptick rule '' a reform instituted after the Great Crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices , namely short sellers .
The Big Board 's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price .
Arbitrage does n't cause volatility ; it responds to it .
Think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for S&P 500 stocks -- usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in Chicago .
In point of fact , volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today .
Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile , usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change -LRB- 1973-75 , 1937-40 , and 1928-33 for example -RRB- .
Some of the proposed fixes for what is labeled `` program-trading volatility '' could be far worse than the perceived problem .
In using program trading as a whipping boy , fundamentalist investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing stock-selection products .
They may , however , risk bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves .

The problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine .
The California Supreme Court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win DES cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs .
DES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts .
Congress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs .
The committee 's members are worried what all this free food might do to the economic prospects of Poland 's own farmers .

Wellcome gained 18 to 666 on a modest 1.1 million shares .
Meanwhile , Treasury bonds ended modestly higher in quiet trading .
The benchmark 30-year bond about 1\/4 point , or $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
Several moves were taken following the October 1987 crash to coordinate -- and sometimes deliberately disconnect -- the stock and futures markets in times of heightened volatility .
On the Big Board , a `` side car '' is put into effect when the S&P futures rise or fall 12 points .
Above all , Mr. Oxnard noted , the situation is extremely confused .
`` Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation , '' he said .
Mexico , which is normally a sugar exporter , has had production problems in the past two years , analysts said .
Last year , it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments , they noted .
Petroleum futures were generally higher with heating oil leading the way .
On the New York Mercantile Exchange , heating oil for December delivery increased 1.25 cents to settle at 60.36 cents a gallon .
But the strength in heating oil helped push up crude oil .
West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 13 cents a barrel to settle at $ 20.07 .
Continued export demand also supported prices .
As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S. , market analysts said that late Tuesday the Chinese government , which often buys U.S. grains in quantity , turned instead to Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat .
Futures prices rose , extending Tuesday 's gains .
The December contract advanced 2.50 cents a pound to $ 1.1650 .
But some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have , because few jobs will end up being eliminated .
`` It 's a cosmetic move , '' said Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder & Co .
Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation .
`` The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped , '' said Bill Biedermann , Allendale Inc. research director .
ENERGY : Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading , but much of the action was in heating oil .
Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire , tightening an already tight European market .
PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets .
December delivery gold fell $ 3.20 an ounce to $ 377.60 .
COPPER : Futures prices partially recovered Monday 's declines because Chilean miners voted to strike .
The December contract rose 1.20 cents a pound to $ 1.14 .
The analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks .
In the case of copper , he said , the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal .
Among segments that continue to operate , though , the company 's steel division continued to suffer from soft demand for its tubular goods serving the oil industry and other markets .
Peter Marcus , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. , said that a downturn in the appliance industry , coupled with sluggish automotive sales , hurt USX results .
The energy segment , with a 15 % rise in operating profit , is clearly the company 's strongest .
Higher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the Marathon Oil Co. unit to $ 198 million from $ 180 million .

He believes in what he plays , and he plays superbly .
His recent appearance at the Metropolitan Museum , dubbed `` A Musical Odyssey , '' was a case in point .

UNESCO somehow converted the founding U.N. ideals of individual rights and liberty into `` peoples ' rights . ''
Million-dollar conferences were held to chew on subjects such as `` ethical responsibilities of scientists in support of disarmament '' and `` the impact of the activities of transnational corporations . ''
The agency was so totally subverted from the high principles of its founding that even the Soviets now wonder about an agency that seemed so congenial to them .
Glasnost may be partly responsible , but Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze last year admitted , `` The exaggerated ideological approach undermined tolerance intrinsic to UNESCO . ''

Both General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have been trying to amass 15 % stakes in Jaguar .
Ford , which already has an unwelcome 13.2 % holding , is prepared to bid for the entire company and had lobbied the government to lift the takeover restrictions early .
The gains also sparked buying interest in other real-estate companies , traders said .
Sumitomo Realty & Development rose 40 to 2170 .
The CD trend runs counter to the direction of short-term interest rates at the Treasury bill auction Monday .
The average six-month bill was sold with a yield of 8.04 % , up from 7.90 % .
Most yields on short-term jumbo CDs , those with denominations over $ 90,000 , also moved in the opposite direction of Treasury bill yields .
The average six-month yield on a jumbo CD was at 7.90 % , down from 7.93 % , Banxquote said .
For longer-term CDs , yields were up .
The average two-year and five-year jumbos were up 0.02 of a percentage point to 7.91 % and 7.96 % , respectively .
Differences between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve on the usefulness of intervention to help restrain the dollar resurfaced at the hearing .
Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson , who had dissented from the Treasury 's policy , told lawmakers , `` I became convinced about what looked to me like an attempt to push the dollar down against the fundamentals in the market . ''
Defining combat aircraft is even tougher .
The Soviets insisted that aircraft be brought into the talks , then argued for exempting some 4,000 Russian planes because they are `` solely defensive . ''
The agreement ended a long impasse between the congressional leaders and the White House over the wage issue .
President Bush in June vetoed a measure passed by Congress and said he would n't accept any minimum-wage rise that went beyond limits he set early in this year 's debate on the issue .
Some Democrats thought they might have compromised too much .
Rep. Austin Murphy -LRB- D. , Pa. -RRB- , chairman of the House labor standards subcommittee , said they might have done better `` if we 'd held their feet to the fire . ''
The result last spring was the arrest by West German authorities of five young West Germans , accused of stealing information from computers in the U.S. and Europe and selling it to the Soviet KGB .
One of them , 25-year-old Markus Hess of Hannover , allegedly used the international telecommunications network to break into more than 30 high-security computers in the U.S. , searching for secrets .
Finding him became an obsession for Mr. Stoll .
He made a midnight requisition of all the printers he could lay hands on so that he could monitor all the telephone lines coming into the lab 's computers .
The hacker was pawing over the Berkeley files but also using Berkeley and other easily accessible computers as stepping stones to the network of computers used by the military and national security agencies .
The White Sands missile range and CIA contractor Mitre Inc. were among the targets .
The FBI initially showed little interest , and he had the impression other federal security agencies were tangled up in legal red tape .
The CIA told him it does not do domestic counterespionage .
Some of the allegations are simply bizarre .
Two former secretaries told the grand jury they were summoned to the judge 's chambers on separate occasions to take dictation , only to find the judge in his bikini underwear .
`` He 's sharp as a tack .
He could grasp an issue with the blink of an eye . ''
The judge was considered imperious , abrasive and ambitious , those who practiced before him say .
He sipped tea sweetened with honey from his high-backed leather chair at his bench , while scribbling notes ordering spectators to stop whispering or to take off their hats in his courtroom .
Even his routine business transactions caused trouble , according to the grand jury report .
When the judge bought his new Sunbird from James E. Black Pontiac-Cadillac in Ebensburg five years ago , the dealership had `` certain apprehensions '' about the judge 's reputation , according to the grand-jury report .
The dealership took the extra step of having all the paper work for the transaction pre-approved by Ebensburg 's local lender , Laurel Bank .
Then , as an additional precaution , the car dealership took the judge 's photograph as he stood next to his new car with sales papers in hand -- proof that he had received the loan documents .
But when the judge received his payment book , he disavowed the deal .
`` There was no loan , there is no loan , there never shall be a loan , '' the judge wrote the bank on his judicial stationery , according to the report .
The judge says he is confident he will return to his old bench .
Already , he notes , the 76 charges originally filed against him have been trimmed to 27 .

Institutional investors that must evaluate poison pills on a regular basis are interested less in this general debate than in the answers to specific questions about the corporation issuing the pill .
Does this corporation have a high-quality management team with a good track record ?
The solution to this problem is a time-limited poison pill .
The limit could range from three years to seven years , depending on the composition of the management team and the nature of its strategic plan .
Officials of Rockefeller Group and Mitsubishi Estate prefer to focus on the affinities , nearly dismissing the threat of a backlash from the U.S. public .
`` We think there will be positive as well as negative reactions , '' says Raymond Pettit , senior vice president and chief financial officer of Rockefeller Group .
Rockefeller may well have found its match in Mitsubishi Estate , a company of long history , strong government ties and sound resources .
In asset terms , Mitsubishi Estate is the largest real estate firm in Japan .
Meanwhile , at home , Mitsubishi has control of some major projects .
It is the largest private-sector landowner of the Minato-Mirai 21 project , a multibillion-yen development in the port city of Yokohama , about an hour outside Tokyo .
But at a time of mounting concern over alcohol abuse , some liquor marketers consider Seagram 's frequent buyer promotion risky .
`` I 'm surprised they 're doing this , '' says Penn Kavanagh , president of Schieffelin & Somerset Co. , which markets Johnnie Walker scotches .
Others question the impact on Chivas 's upscale image of a promotion that has customers soaking off labels .
`` It 's really bizarre , '' says Albert Lerman , creative director at the Wells Rich Greene ad agency .
Chivas Class is n't the first such promotion .

In 1988 , a year and a half after Mrs. Marcos and her late husband , Ferdinand Marcos , the ousted president of the Philippines , fled the Philippines for Hawaii , they were charged with racketeering , conspiracy , obstruction of justice and mail fraud in a scheme in which they allegedly embezzled more than $ 100 million from their homeland .
Much of the money was fraudulently concealed through purchases of prime Manhattan real estate , federal prosecutors have charged .
The judge also said the two marital testimonial privileges cited by Mrs. Marcos do n't apply .
The first one permits a witness to refuse to testify against her spouse .
But Judge Keenan said that privilege 's purpose is `` fostering harmony in marriage . ''
Because Mr. Marcos died Sept. 28 , the privilege can no longer apply , the judge said .
At that time , tasks were assigned strictly on the basis of seniority .

Despite the pain of adjusting , the cultural revolution has begun to yield exciting cars .
A year ago , the company completely revamped its near-luxury sedan , the $ 17,699 Maxima , which competes against a broad range of upscale sedans ; it replaced its boxy , pug-nosed body with sleek , aerodynamic lines .
Nissan helped develop a Tokyo restaurant with both vehicles as its design theme .
The chairs are S-Cargo seats , and a gift shop sells such items as alarm clocks styled like the Pao 's oversized speedometer .
The big reason : For all its cost-cutting , Nissan remains less efficient than Toyota .
In its last fiscal year , Nissan 's profit represented just 2.3 % of sales , compared with 4.3 % at Toyota .

Corporate leaders , frustrated by double-digit increases in health-care costs , are beginning to sound like liberal Democrats .
Failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could `` lead some of us who today are free-market advocates to re-examine our thinking and positions with respect to government-sponsored national health insurance , '' Arthur Puccini , a General Electric Co. vice president , warned earlier this year .
But there are signs that labor-management cooperation could change the politics of health-care legislation and the economics of medicine .
`` I ca n't remember a time when virtually everyone can agree on what the problem is , '' says Mr. Seidman , who heads the AFL-CIO 's department dealing with health matters .
`` It 's a bottom-line issue . ''
Business complained earlier this year when Sen. Kennedy introduced a bill that would require employers to provide a minimum level of health insurance to workers but does n't contain cost-control measures .

Senior members of the House Budget Committee are reduced in frustration to raising doomed parliamentary obstacles to individual bills , yet admit that much of the disorder now stems from the fiscal legerdemain associated with their own summit agreement with the White House this past spring .
`` It 's hard to get the administration 's attention on anything , '' said Rep. Bill Frenzel -LRB- R. , Minn. -RRB- , `` because the whole agreement was built on gimmickry . ''
The same jealousy can breed confusion , however , in the absence of any authorization bill this year .
House and Senate appropriators sought to establish a Nov. 30 deadline after which their bill would become the last word on how funds are distributed .
But on a 53-45 roll call this provision was stripped from the bill last night after Foreign Relations Chairman Claiborne Pell -LRB- D. , R.I . -RRB- complained that it was an intrusion on exclusive powers vested in his panel for more than three decades .
Since the value of its assets was n't known , analysts were free to pick a number .
In one of many rosy scenarios , Bear Stearns 's Gary Schneider wrote in March that its real estate alone had a value of $ 4.5 billion .

Exchange officials emphasized that the Big Board is considering a variety of actions to deal with program trading .
People familiar with the exchange said another idea likely to be approved is expanding the monthly reports on program trading to cover specific days or even hours of heavy program trading and who was doing it .
For example , in a special meeting Monday with Mr. Phelan , senior officials of some of the Big Board 's 49 stock specialist firms complained that the exchange is no longer representing their interests .
`` We are looking for representation we have n't had , '' a specialist said .
`` A lot of people would like to go back to 1970 , '' before program trading , he said .

The benchmark 30-year bond was nearly 1\/4 point higher , or up about $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
One reason for his gloom is a weekly tally he keeps of stocks within a point of hitting new highs or lows .
Last Friday , 96 stocks on the Big Board hit new 12-month lows .

But `` the Soviet Union has areas where it is n't behind Japan , '' says Mikhail Shapovalov of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations .
`` We have obtained through the development of Cosmos -LCB- the Soviet space program -RCB- technologies you do n't see anywhere else . ''
And , despite its image as a technology superpower , Japan has a lot of weaknesses .
It 's a world leader in semiconductors , but behind the U.S. in making the computers that use those chips .
One question being debated in the Soviet Union is how to use the defense sector 's research-and-production expertise in the rest of the economy .
Many plants that used to make military equipment are now being ordered to produce televisions , videocassette recorders , small tractors and food-processing machinery .
By contrast , the Japanese have proved adept at making use of Soviet inventions .
Kobe Steel Ltd. adopted Soviet casting technology in 1966 and used it for 14 years until it developed its own system .
Soviet efforts to sell their technology abroad do n't appear to worry the U.S. , Japan 's principal ally .
`` We have never opposed the development of economic relations between our allies and the Soviet Union , '' says a State Department official .
Ray Garrett Jr. , SEC chairman , said the `` breadth and depth of the discounting is more than I expected . ''

Half of those surveyed said they simply walk these days for exercise .
Mr. Doyle predicts a trend toward fewer pieces of home exercise equipment being sold at higher prices .

A surprising 78 % of people said they exercise regularly , up from 73 % in 1981 .
Only walking and golf increased in popularity during the 1980s -- and only slightly .
Jeanette Traverso , a California lawyer , gave up running three times a week to play a weekly round of golf , finding it more social and serene .
Most people said they exercise both for health and enjoyment .
`` If you sit down all the time , you 'll go stiff , '' says Joyce Hagood , a Roxboro , N.C. , homemaker who walks several miles a week .

Tales of haunts and horrors are proliferating beyond the nation 's Elm Streets and Amityvilles .
`` I get calls nearly every day from people who have ghosts in their house , '' says Raymond Hyman , a skeptical psychology professor at the University of Oregon .
On a recent afternoon , Mr. Baker and a reporter go ghost-busting , visiting Kathleen Stinnett , a Lexington woman who has phoned the University of Kentucky to report mysterious happenings in her house .
Mrs. Stinnett says she never believed in ghosts before , but lately her vacuum cleaner turned itself on , a telephone flew off its stand , doors slammed inexplicably , and she heard footsteps in her empty kitchen .
Mr. Baker hears her out , pokes around a bit , asks a few questions and proposes some explanations .
Of the self-starting vacuum cleaner , he says : `` Could be Cuddles , -LCB- Mrs. Stinnett 's dog -RCB- . ''
The flying telephone : `` You tangle the base cord around a chair leg , and the receiver does seem to fly off . ''
The ghostly footsteps : `` Interstate 64 is a block away , and heavy traffic can sure set a house to vibrating . ''
But sometimes more energetic attacks are required .

It 's not uncommon to wait three minutes for a dial tone after picking up the telephone , and then to be interrupted by a busy signal before finishing dialing the number .
Mr. Conn charges that Humana 's own actions undermine its argument .
When a hospital in Lexington installed a lithotripter last year , demand for a similar kidney-stone smashing machine at a Humana hospital in Louisville fell 34 % .
The Humana hospital responded by jacking up prices to make up for lost revenue , Mr. Conn says , and now charges as much as $ 8,000 for the procedure , which costs only about $ 3,500 in Lexington .
One trend that continues is growth in the money invested in funds .
Buoyed by the continued inflows into money funds , assets of all mutual funds swelled to a record $ 953.8 billion in September , up fractionally from $ 949.3 billion in August .
Letting officials express their own nuances can be educational .

And the Kennedy amendment would invade not only federal but state sentencings , in two important ways .
It would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing racially disproportionate application of the death penalty in the past .

It might force Congress and the states to narrow the death penalty only to convictions shown to be relatively free of racial imbalance -- murders by repeat offenders who torture their victims , perhaps .

Now , the personal-computer revolution is finally reaching Japan .
Kawasaki-Rikuso , a freight company , set up its own software subsidiary this year and is spending nearly a year 's profit to more than double the computer terminals at its main office .
But it also offers opportunities
Americans are well poised to supply the weapons
After years of talking about selling in Japan , more and more U.S. companies are seriously pouring in .
Apple Computer Inc. has doubled its staff here over the past year .
But the Japanese have to go a long way to catch up .
Typical is one office of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 's Machinery and Information Industries Bureau -- the main bureaucracy overseeing the computer industry .
`` Personal Computer '' yearbooks are lined up on nearly every desk , and dog-eared copies of Nikkei Computer crowd magazine racks .
But amid the two dozen bureaucrats and secretaries sits only one real-life PC .
Because the Japanese `` alphabet '' is so huge , Japan has no history of typewriter use , and so `` keyboard allergy , '' especially among older workers , remains a common affliction .
`` I have no experience before with such sophisticated machinery , '' says Matsuo Toshimitsu , a 66-year-old executive vice president of Japan Air Lines , explaining his reluctance before accepting a terminal in his office this summer .
That is the state of Japan 's computer industry .
NEC wo n't release its code , and every one of the dozen or so makers has its own proprietary operating system -- all incompatible with each other .
The result , according to many analysts , is higher prices and less innovation .
While tens of thousands of software packages using the IBM standard are available in the U.S. , they say only about 8,000 are written for NEC .
In the private sector , practically every major company is setting explicit goals to increase employees ' exposure to computers .
Toyota Motor Corp. 's sales offices in Japan have one-tenth the computers per employee that its own U.S. offices do ; over the next five years , it is aiming for rough parity .
Meanwhile , more computer makers now are competing for the new business .
Seiko Epson Corp. , a newcomer to the industry , fought off a legal challenge and started selling NEC clones last year .
Many of the companies are even dropping their traditional independence and trying to band together to create some sort of standard .
Two years ago , most of the smaller makers joined under the Microsoft Corp. umbrella to adopt a version of the American IBM AT standard .
They long made little effort here .
IBM , though long a leader in the Japanese mainframe business , did n't introduce its first PC in Japan until five years after NEC did , and that was n't compatible even with the U.S. IBM standard .
But the U.S. companies are redoubling their efforts .
Apple recently hired its first Japanese president , luring away an official of Toshiba 's European operations , as well as a whole Japanese top-management team .
Some abortion advocates have been asking themselves this very question .
RU-486 `` probably represents a technical advance in an area where none is needed , or at least not very much , '' said Phillip Stubblefield , president of the National Abortion Federation , at a reproductive health conference in 1986 .
In the year since the pill went on the French market , the National Organization for Women and its offshoot , former NOW President Eleanor Smeal 's Fund for a Feminist Majority , have been trying to browbeat the U.S. pharmaceutical industry into getting involved .
-LRB- Its scare-tactic prediction : the pill `` will be available in the U.S. , either legally or illegally , in no more than 2-5 years . '' -RRB-
Following the feminist and population-control lead has been a generally bovine press .
A June 1988 article in Mother Jones magazine is typical of the general level of media ignorance .
We do not know whether RU-486 will be as disastrous as some of the earlier fertility-control methods released to unblinking , uncritical cheers from educated people who should have known better .
-LRB- Remember the Dalkon Shield and the early birth-control pills ? -RRB-
That has n't deterred plenty of companies .
Along with Nissan , Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King and New York Life Insurance have tied ads to Red Cross donations .
Other ads do n't bother with the fundraising
a touching , if self-congratulatory , American Telephone & Telegraph ad that aired Sunday intermixed footage of the devastation in San Francisco and Charleston , S.C. , with interviews of people recounting how AT&T helped
While TV commercials typically take weeks to produce , advertisers in the past couple of years have learned to turn on a dime , to crash out ads in days or even hours .
The big brokerage houses learned the art of the instant commercial after the 1987 crash , when they turned out reassuring ads inviting investors right back into the stock market .
The companies running the disaster ads certainly do n't see themselves as ambulance chasers , either .
Burger King 's chief executive officer , Barry Gibbons , stars in ads saying that the fast-food chain will donate 25 cents to the Red Cross for every purchase of a BK Doubles hamburger .
The campaign , which started last week and runs through Nov. 23 , with funds earmarked for both the quake and Hugo , `` was Barry 's idea , '' a spokeswoman says .
`` Barry felt very committed .
It could point to plenty of ailments that the Spanish economic rejuvenation so far has failed to cure .

They are very considerable
Since 1986 , when Spain joined the European Community , its gross domestic product has grown at an annual average of 4.6 % -- the fastest in the EC
Mr. Gonzalez is not quite a closet supply-side revolutionary , however .
He did not go as far as he could have in tax reductions ; indeed he combined them with increases in indirect taxes .
Now he can go further .
He should do more to reduce tax rates on wealth and income , in recognition of the fact that those cuts yield higher , not lower , revenues .
The selling by money managers and individual investors is turning traders bearish as well .
`` We are advising a lot of our clients to make moves that make sense to them , rather than waiting until the last minute , because things have been so volatile , '' said William Sulya , head of OTC trading at A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis .
Evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other cancers , too .

Some of Mr. Peladeau 's ventures , including an earlier push into the U.S. market , have n't paid off on the bottom line .
Quebecor started the Philadelphia Journal , a daily tabloid , in 1977 and closed it three years later .

Some former strike-force personnel say the units have already begun to break up .
The Eastern District unit in Brooklyn , N.Y. , lost seven of its 15 attorneys this year partly because the lawyers were troubled by the proposed reorganization , says Laura A. Brevetti , who left the strike force to join Morrison Cohen Singer & Weinstein , a New York law firm .
Some congressional leaders intend to continue to fight for independent strike forces .

Still , Boeing went through its normal verbal gymnastics and played up the downside .
In a statement , Chairman Frank Shrontz asserted that the company `` faces significant challenges and risks , '' on both its commercial and government contracts .
And , of course , there 's the unsteady labor situation .

Allianz 's entry reflects the increasing eagerness of West German companies , looking ahead to the reduction in European Community internal barriers in 1992 , to get involved in what until now were considered internal French affairs .

But the news of the boom has yet to trickle down to the farmers .
They only know of one use for the crop , as a laxative , and with psyllium prices currently languishing in the wake of a bumper crop , they think of the seed as a marginal crop , something to grow between summer wheat crops .
Mr. Jath is thinking of passing up psyllium altogether this year in favor of a crop with a future such as cumin or fennel .

That 's not all .
Departing from its newspaper ads featuring prim sketches of a suit or a coat , Brooks Brothers is marketing an updated image in a new campaign that carries the slogan , `` The Surprise of Brooks Brothers . ''
As part of its national ad pitch , Brooks Brothers will show less preppy women 's clothes , moving away from its floppy-tie business stereotype .
One ad shows a bright red jacket paired with a black leather skirt .
`` Everybody forgets that there are fashion cycles in classic merchandise , '' observes Carol Farmer , a retail consultant .
`` For women , dressing for success in a real structured way is over . ''
Brooks Brothers is also remodeling its stores .

At the center of any court fight will be the differing interpretations of the written contract between Warner and the two producers , but other murkier issues will play a big role .
Sony and the Guber-Peters team are hanging much of their case on Warner 's willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement they say allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up .
Just how rancorous the relationship has become is clear from the differing versions of the two sides ' current business dealings .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say in their affidavits that Warner already is taking steps to freeze them out of their projects at Warner , notably the Sylvester Stallone film `` Tango and Cash . ''
Even White House budget director Richard Darman had trouble finding a silver lining in the report .

Such risk taking is an everyday matter for the brash Mr. Nadir , who is 25 % owner of Polly Peck as well as its chairman .
He took Polly Peck , once a small fabric wholesaler , and used it at as a base to build a conglomerate that has been doubling its profits annually since 1980 .
This gap eventually closes , but slowly .
Three days later , as of Friday 's close , the Nasdaq Composite was down 6 % , compared with 5.9 % for the industrial average , 5.7 % for the S&P 500 and 5.8 % for the Big Board Composite .
But industry watchers expect them to blend the methodical marketing strategies they use for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics companies .
Likely changes include more emphasis on research , soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing .
P&G already has shown it can meld some traditional packaged-goods techniques with the image-making of the cosmetics trade in the mass-market end of the business .
Consider Oil of Olay , which P&G acquired as part of Richardson-Vicks International in 1985 .
Goliaths like Unilever and P&G have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals .
Next year , Noxell plans to roll out a perfume called Navy , says George L. Bunting Jr. , chairman of Noxell .
Further consolidations in the industry could follow .
Rumors that Unilever is interested in acquiring Schering-Plough Corp. 's Maybelline unit are widespread .
But success for Unilever and P&G is far from guaranteed , as shown by the many consumer-product companies that have tried and failed to master the quirky beauty business .
In the 1970s , several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies , including Colgate-Palmolive Co. , Eli Lilly & Co. , Pfizer Inc. and Schering-Plough acquired cosmetics companies .
The White House used television appearances and leaks to argue that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made U.S. support for such coups difficult .
Mr. Bush even disclosed privately that one Reagan-era deal with Congress required him to notify the odious Panamanian dictator , Manuel Noriega , if the U.S. learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life .
The senators responded in kind .
Sen. Boren happily told reporters that there had been `` a meeting of the minds '' with the White House , and that the committee had given Mr. Bush `` a clean slate , '' free of the impediments imposed during the Reagan years .
There still are some details to be nailed down .
Mr. Bush is reserving the right in `` rare '' instances to keep Congress in the dark , asserting a constitutional prerogative the committee does n't recognize .
Moreover , both sides may face political critics .
Some conservatives will accuse the president of promising Congress too much .
It has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System , which links the major EC currencies .
At a June EC summit , Mrs. Thatcher appeared to ease her opposition to full EMS membership , saying Britain would join once its inflation rate fell and the EC liberalized capital movements .
As Conservatives rally around Mrs. Thatcher during the crisis , many harbor hopes last week 's debacle will prompt change .
`` We wo n't have any more of this wayward behavior , '' says Sir Peter Hordern , a backbench Tory member of Parliament .
October was an edgy month for the practitioners of glasnost , the official Soviet policy of allowing more candor from the nation 's media .
For one of the superstars of glasnost , Vitaly Korotich , editor of the trail-blazing weekly Ogonyok , Friday , Oct. 20 was a somersaulting day that turned from tension to elation .
The czars were no civil libertarians .
As late as the 1890s , the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines .
What is that point ?
Will Ogonyok begin a series of reports analyzing the failures of perestroika ?
Mr. Greenspan 's decision to keep quiet also prompted a near-mutiny within the Fed 's ranks .
A `` senior Fed official '' spoke on Saturday after the market swoon to both the Washington Post and the New York Times , saying the Fed was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed .
Ironically , the anonymous official 's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. Greenspan , who is mistakenly seen as the source .
At a hearing last week , Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut told Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that `` Chairman Greenspan 's '' announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a `` very important statement . ''
The Fed chairman 's caution was apparent again on the Monday morning after the market 's plunge , when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets .
A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system .
The economy is showing signs of weakness , particularly among manufacturers .
Exports , which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years , seem to have stalled .
But such caution is no guarantee against mistakes .
The Fed 's reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the groundwork for a new recession , perhaps starting early next year .
In an age of specialization , the federal judiciary is one of the last bastions of the generalist .
A judge must jump from murder to antitrust cases , from arson to securities fraud , without missing a beat .
Three seats currently are vacant and three others are likely to be filled within a few years , so patent lawyers and research-based industries are making a new push for specialists to be added to the court .
Several organizations , including the Industrial Biotechnical Association and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association , have asked the White House and Justice Department to name candidates with both patent and scientific backgrounds .
The Justice Department 's view is shared by other lawyers and at least one member of the court , Judge H. Robert Mayer , a former civil litigator who served at the claims court trial level before he was appointed to the Federal Circuit two years ago .
`` I believe that any good lawyer should be able to figure out and understand patent law , '' Judge Mayer says , adding that `` it 's the responsibility of highly paid lawyers -LRB- who argue before the court -RRB- to make us understand -LRB- complex patent litigation -RRB- . ''
Mr. Carpenter , a former consulting-firm executive who has a love for `` task forces , '' says he has done a `` complete rethink '' of Kidder in recent months .
There have been a dizzying parade of studies of the firm 's operations .
Yet , says Mr. Carpenter , `` We 've really started to exploit the synergy between GE Capital and Kidder Peabody . ''
The units have worked on 37 investment banking deals this year , he says , though not all of them have panned out .
Everywhere , Kidder stresses the `` always working '' theme .
A new in-house magazine , Kidder World -- which will focus on the firm 's synergy strategy , says Mr. Carpenter -- confides that on weekends Mr. Newquist `` often gets value-added ideas while flying his single-engine Cessna Centurion on the way to Nantucket . ''
Indeed , although a majority of Republican lawmakers favor a line-item veto , some , ranging from liberal Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield to conservative Rep. Edwards are opposed .
Rep. Edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it 's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person .
Kellogg indicated that it has room to grow without adding facilities .
The company has five other U.S. plants , including a modern facility at its Battle Creek headquarters known as Building 100 , which is to add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next year .
But in recent weeks , construction-industry sources reported that early preparation work was slowing at the 185-acre site .
Subcontractors said they were told that equipment orders would be delayed .
Expansion plans also include acquisitions in growing foreign markets .
The bank says it 's interested in purchasing banks in Morocco , Portugal and Puerto Rico .
Mr. Pearce has also encouraged his staff to work more closely with GM 's technical staffs to help prevent future litigation .
GM lawyers have been working with technicians to develop more uniform welding procedures -- the way a vehicle is welded has a lot to do with its durability .
Another finding from the study : Prosecutors set significantly different priorities .
The Manhattan U.S. attorney 's office stressed criminal cases from 1980 to 1987 , averaging 43 for every 100,000 adults .
But the New Jersey U.S. attorney averaged 16 .
On the civil side , the Manhattan prosecutor filed an average of only 11 cases for every 100,000 adults during the same period ; the San Francisco U.S. attorney averaged 79 .
But the mega-issues are raising megaquestions about the rapidly evolving Indian capital market .
One is whether there is enough money to fund the new issues without depressing stock trading .
Some analysts are concerned that the mega-issues , in such an unregulated environment , could lead to a mega-crash .
`` The rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the mega-projects , '' says G.S. Patel , a former chairman of the giant , government-run mutual fund , the Unit Trust of India .
When Mr. Gandhi came to power , he ushered in new rules for business .
He said industry should build plants on the same scale as those outside India and benefit from economies of scale .
If the output was too great for the domestic market , he said , companies should export .
So far , the mega-issues are a hit with investors .
Earlier this year , Tata Iron & Steel Co. 's offer of $ 355 million of convertible debentures was oversubscribed .
`` Disclosures are very poor in India . ''
He says the big questions -- `` Do you really need this much money to put up these investments ? Have you told investors what is happening in your sector ? What about your track record ? -- `` are n't asked of companies coming to market .

-LRB- Reliance floated a $ 357 million petrochemical company in 1988 that was , at the time , the largest public issue in Indian history . -RRB-
ABC News has similarly branched out into entertainment gimmickry .
`` Prime Time Live , '' a new show this season featuring Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer , has a studio audience that applauds and that one night -LRB- to the embarrassment of the network -RRB- waved at the camera like the crowd on `` Let 's Make a Deal . ''
The network deals a lot with unknowns , including Scott Wentworth , who portrayed Mr. Anderson , and Bill Alton as Father Jenco , but the network has some big names to contend with , too .
James Earl Jones is cast to play the Rev. Mr. Johns .
Re-creating events has , in general , upset news traditionalists , including former CBS News President Richard S. Salant and former NBC News President Reuven Frank , former CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite and the new dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism , Joan Konner .
Says she : `` Once you add dramatizations , it 's no longer news , it 's drama , and that has no place on a network news broadcast ... .
Criticism of the Abbie Hoffman segment is particularly scathing among people who knew and loved the man .

Though Dentsu says it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines , it is laying the groundwork for international growth .
It is setting up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad .
But Japanese agencies are cautious about expanding abroad because client relationships are different .
Japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry , a practice `` that would be unacceptable by traditional Western conflict rules , '' says Roy Warman , the London chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi 's communications division .
But the notebook , with the more advanced microprocessor and hard disk , is more innovative .

Mr. Lagnado said strength in employment appears to have the biggest impact on sales growth .
El Paso , Austin and Fort Worth , the three strongest retail markets in the nation , are all located in Texas , where employment grew a relatively strong 2 % .
The results reflect a reversal in the fortunes of the regions during the past two years .
In 1987 , the West had the slowest sales growth , and the South and the Midwest were first and second respectively , according to the council .
Mr. Lagnado said that although retailers probably wo n't ever recover sales lost because of the California quake and Hurricane Hugo , they could see some benefits later on .
Stores such as Sears that sell big-ticket durable goods might actually get a boost as consumers rush to replace items lost in the disasters , he said .
Insurers buy this insurance protection for themselves by giving up a portion of the premiums they collect on a policy to another firm -- a reinsurance company , which , in turn , accepts a portion of any losses resulting from this policy .
Insurers , such as Cigna Corp. , Transamerica Corp , and Aetna Life & Casualty Co. , buy reinsurance from other U.S.-based companies and Lloyd 's of London for one catastrophe at a time .
But some large insurers , such as State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. , do n't purchase reinsurance , but fund their own program .
A few years ago , State Farm , the nation 's largest home insurer , stopped buying reinsurance because no one carrier could provide all the coverage that it needed and the company found it cheaper to self-reinsure .
Mr. Ortega 's threat to breach the cease-fire comes as U.S. officials were acknowledging that the Contras have at times violated it themselves .
Secretary of State James Baker , who accompanied President Bush to Costa Rica , told reporters Friday : `` I have no reason to deny reports that some Contras ambushed some Sandinista soldiers . ''
Administration officials traveling with President Bush in Costa Rica interpreted Mr. Ortega 's wavering as a sign that he is n't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections .
Mr. Abrams said that Mr. Ortega is seeking to demobilize the Contras prior to the elections to remove any pressure to hold fair elections .
Mr. Thompson is n't bereft of experience with new products , however .
For the past two years , he said , he and the exchange 's research department have been working on the new natural gas contract , seeking a good delivery site and studying the natural gas market .
In a recent General Accounting Office study , the Merc was found to have been the most lax in enforcing exchange rules .
It levied the smallest number of suspensions of traders and fines of the four largest commodity exchanges studied over the past five years .
He thinks that progress in cooperation can be made in areas where no vested interests have built up .
One of those areas is the development of a hand-held electronic device that would permit floor traders to enter trades as they make them .
Lorne Slotnick , vice chairman of the Southern Ontario Newspaper Guild , the union representing the workers , said Thomson made significant concessions in the final round of talks .
In addition to wage increases , the union negotiated improved vacation plans , benefit packages and pension plans , Mr. Slotnick said .
Other analysts are nearly as pessimistic .
Gary Palmero of Oppenheimer & Co. expects a 30 % decline in earnings between now and 1991 for `` commodity-oriented '' paper companies , which account for the majority of the industry .
The companies in question believe the analysts are too pessimistic .
Great Northern Nekoosa said , `` The odds of the dire predictions about us being right are small . ''
Wall Street is n't avoiding everything connected with paper .
Mr. Palmero recommends Temple-Inland , explaining that it is `` virtually the sole major paper company not undergoing a major capacity expansion , '' and thus should be able to lower long-term debt substantially next year .
The analysts say their gloomy forecasts have a flip side .
Some take a warm view of consumer-oriented paper companies , which buy pulp from the commodity producers and should benefit from the expected declines in pulp prices .
Bond market analysts say the institutional selling was triggered by several factors .
Big banks such as Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan , which have been taking heavy charges to expand their Third World loan-loss reserves , are n't looking for tax-exempt income .
Fundamental factors are at work as well .
Muni bond holders are worried about the impact of a slowing economy on tax revenue , at a time when many state and local governments already face budget deficits and huge spending needs .
New York City bonds have been beaten down for three straight weeks .
On Friday , some issues fell nearly one point , or close to $ 10 for each $ 1,000 face amount .

The swift passage of the bill , which cleared the Senate and House on simple voice votes last week , contrasts with the problems still facing a more cumbersome $ 66.8 billion measure funding housing , environmental , space and veterans programs .
By an 84-6 margin , the Senate approved the bulk of the spending Friday , but the bill was then sent back to the House to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit allocations for the Federal Housing Administration .
Many of the problems you presented exist in every part of this country .
Poverty is only two blocks from President Bush 's residence .
There are , however , some alternatives that income-oriented investors should consider , investment advisers say .
Short-term municipal bonds , bond funds and tax-deferred annuities are some of the choices they mention -- and not just as a way to get a higher return .
These insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as non-deductible individual retirement accounts : Investment gains are compounded without tax consequences until money is withdrawn , but a 10 % penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals made before age 59 1\/2 .
Aimed specifically at CD holders are so-called CD-type annuities , or certificates of annuity .

The view of some others in Big Oil , he maintains , `` is very much -LCB- similar to -RCB- Amoco 's outlook . ''
Just this week Mobil Corp. disclosed new cutbacks in its domestic exploration and production operations .
The activity is enough to move some oil-service prices back up a little .

Texaco , thinking in terms of $ 18-to-$19 oil for 1990 , may raise spending , especially for low-risk prospects , an official says .
The appetite for oil-service stocks has been especially strong , although some got hit yesterday when Shearson Lehman Hutton cut its short-term investment ratings on them .

Margin requirements for speculators on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are currently about 7 % .
Politics also influences the government 's thinking on the anti-takeover restriction .

When his wife , Betsy , came down the aisle on their wedding day in 1966 , Mr. Engelken -- no slouch on the romantic front -- gave her the ultimate compliment : `` You look prettier than Bobby Thomson 's home run . ''

I can attest that a recent Colombian visitor to the U.S. was offered drugs three times in the few blocks ' walk between Grand Central Terminal and the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan .
Much is being done in Colombia to fight the drug cartel mafia .
Luxurious homes and ranches have been raided by the military authorities , and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized .

Now , as election day nears , even some supporters wonder what he will do if he wins the mayoralty on Nov. 7 .
They wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies , including union leaders and political cronies who may seek a place at the trough .
In an interview with reporters and editors of The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the mayoralty .
`` A lot of people think I will give away the store , but I can assure you I will not , '' he says .
Over the last few weeks , he has frittered away roughly half of what was once a 33-point lead in the polls over Mr. Giuliani .
A story about how he mishandled the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political patron Percy Sutton was allowed to fester a full week before Mr. Dinkins faced the media .
But by most accounts , he made little of the post and was best known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city 's Board of Estimate , the body that votes on crucial budget and land-use matters .
Colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would crawl into the early morning hours as Mr. Dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss , en masse , certain controversial proposals .
Often , Mr. Dinkins 's procrastination prevented him from having a say in the way things turned out , critics claim .
On the campaign stump , he often points out that he was the only Board of Estimate member to vote against a controversial real-estate project at Manhattan 's Columbus Circle .
But board members say he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided , it was too late to try to draw other members to his position .
While his public statements have at times been confusing , Mr. Dinkins 's position papers have more consistently reflected anti-development sentiment .
He favors a form of commercial rent control , which the financial community believes would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city .
But Mr. Dinkins 's economic planks do n't seem to bother the business community , where he draws significant support .
Steven Spinola , president of the Real Estate Board of New York , an industry organization , says Mr. Dinkins 's `` economic development program is shortsighted , but when it comes down to it , he can be reasonable . ''
But Mr. Dinkins 's sense of pragmatism often comes across more as an insider 's determination not to upset the political apple cart .
He is taken aback in an interview when asked whether , as mayor , he plans on reforming the political `` fiefdoms '' that perpetuate the monumental ineffectiveness of New York 's school system .
Once inside , she spends nearly four hours measuring and diagramming each room in the 80-year-old house , gathering enough information to estimate what it would cost to rebuild it .

Still , Mr. Mack says he talks to `` 30 members of Congress a week . ''
Other scandal survivors are sometimes the best source of solace .

Consider the troubling dissonance between Mr. Shevardnadze 's speech of confession this week and the hang-tough defense of everyone concerned with the Iran-Contra affair .
The Soviet foreign minister publicly concedes that his government `` violated norms of behavior '' in Afghanistan and just plain lied about the radar station .
We have people in high place still lying through their teeth about Iran-Contra , and that apparently is n't going to change .

These were only two of a series of fabrications that had , in Judge Kozinski 's words , the cumulative effect of making Mr. Masson `` appear more arrogant , less sensitive , shallower , more self-aggrandizing , and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements . ''
As Robert Coles wrote in a review of Ms. Malcolm 's book , Mr. Masson emerges `` as a grandiose egotist ... and , in the end , a self-destructive fool .
But it is not Janet Malcolm who calls him such : his own words reveal this psychological profile . ''
It has always been so .
In the 1920s , a young schoolteacher , John T. Scopes , volunteered to be a guinea pig in a test case sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the Tennessee Legislature .
The result was a world-famous trial exposing profound cultural conflicts in American life between the `` smart set , '' whose spokesman was H.L. Mencken , and the religious fundamentalists , whom Mencken derided as benighted primitives .
Few now recall the actual outcome : Scopes was convicted and fined $ 100 , and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive under Tennessee law .

Japan 's steelmakers are raising capital spending 22 % this year to $ 4.8 billion .
Hitachi Zosen Corp. , a shipbuilder buried in debt just a few years ago , will build a machinery plant , its first expansion in 14 years .
They fear that the boom may be too big for Japan 's or anyone else 's good .
`` It 's an explosive cocktail '' thrown at the world , says Kenneth Courtis , senior economist at the Tokyo unit of Deutsche Bank Group .
Not everyone is worried , however .
Some economists -- and many Japanese companies -- are puzzled by the warnings .
Japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money , especially on high-priced goods such as 29-inch television sets and luxury cars .
Nissan Motor Co. 's domestic auto sales are up 20 % this year largely because its expensive Cima , Sylvia and Cefiro models are in heavy demand .
Among them are the shipbuilders , which had halved their shipyard work forces to cut costs during a prolonged slump in demand but now are capturing an increased share of the strengthening global market .
Sasebo Heavy Industries Co. , a medium-sized shipbuilder , expects its sales to increase 30 % this year , largely because of rising demand for oil tankers .
The emphasis on market share is evident at Daikin Industries Ltd. , Japan 's biggest maker of industrial air conditioners .
Seeing new office buildings sprout up and its sales soar , Daikin is building another plant , which will lift its production capacity 50 % .
The expansion is aimed not just at meeting demand but also at expanding the company 's market share to 30 % from 27 % currently .
The competition is even more heated in the auto industry , where companies are racing one another in a world-wide market .
Nissan aims to expand its 25 % share of the market to 30 % by spending $ 141 million on a plant in southern Japan that could make as many as 240,000 cars a year .
Those who are n't worried about how Japanese manufacturers ' investments will affect trade note that many new products are n't replacements for imports .

Meanwhile , Toshiba 's Japanese rivals , Hitachi , Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp. , are n't sitting still .
After doubling production in one plant , NEC is spending $ 275 million to build another plant that , in two years , will be able to make a million four-megabit DRAMs a year .
Some of Japan 's goods being produced as a result of the investment boom are already successful overseas .
Toyota 's $ 35,000 Lexus automobile , a luxury model that it started shipping to the U.S. only last month , is racking up orders at a time when U.S.-made luxury-car sales are slow .

Jay Stevens , an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds , said he expected the Sunnyvale , Calif. , company to earn 35 cents a share for the quarter and said the firm 's weaker profit was partly the result of increased competition from International Business Machines Corp. , Amdahl 's principal competitor for mainframe sales .

`` The networks are paying too much for rights , '' warns adman Paul Isacsson of Young & Rubicam .
`` What happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports , '' says Peter Lund , a former CBS Sports president now at Multimedia Inc .
J. William Grimes , former president of ESPN , says NBC may `` come in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from CBS and say , ` We can overbid , too . '

NBC will pay a record $ 401 million for the 1992 Summer Games
Mr. Pilson gave him one
He bid $ 243 million for rights to the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville , France
It alone is n't likely to stop a station from dumping CBS shows .
`` The World Series , seven nights , was n't enough of an incentive , '' says Arnold Klinsky of WHEC-TV in Rochester , which dropped CBS for NBC six weeks ago .
And avoiding such losses will take a monumental effort .
On the $ 1.06 billion baseball agreement alone , CBS is likely to lose $ 250 million in four years , contends Mr. Wussler , the former CBS man , now at Comsat Inc .
Advertisers are resisting higher prices , which would help close the gap .
CBS signed General Motors and Toyota to be the only auto-maker sponsors in baseball for four years .
Price : $ 265 million .
But ad executives who negotiated the deal say that works out to only $ 275,000 for a 30-second ad in the World Series through 1993 -- 17 % less than what ABC is charging for the Series this month .
But CBS 's costs are huge , and the risks go up with each new sports package that CBS locks up .
Although sports officials predict jumps of 50 % to 100 % in the major contracts coming up for renewal , ad rates may rise only 20 % .
The Communications Workers of America , which opposes such monitoring , says supervisors listen in on an estimated 400 million calls each year .

`` Demand for these systems has been very , very strong , '' said Bill Grabe , a senior IBM marketing executive .
`` We have a good strong backlog for the fourth quarter even without '' the systems that were announced yesterday .
On Capitol Hill , though , there does n't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital gains and the deficit-reduction bill .
Texas Rep. William Archer , the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee said , `` I do n't see how we have the votes '' to place a capital-gains tax cut there .
Some lawyers say the slump , while more obvious in recent weeks , began earlier this year .
Dennis Block , a partner at the New York firm of Weil , Gotshal & Manges , said that in the first eight months of this year , 89 hostile offers were launched , compared with 157 for the first eight months of

Anti-abortion forces regard him as at best an uncertain ally .
`` In all honesty if you ask me , ` Is this man a true believer ? ' I do n't know , '' says John Fowler , head of the Washington-based Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life Inc .
Yet abortion-rights forces remain bitterly critical .
Douglas Gould , vice president of communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , calls Mr. Bush 's position on the abortion-funding issue `` extremely cruel , '' adding : `` The guy has n't done one thing about prevention .
These days , when others raise the subject of abortion , the usually loquacious president can be close-mouthed almost to the point of curtness .
Ten days ago he was asked to amplify the reasons behind his anti-abortion stance .
`` My position is well-known and well-stated , '' he replied .
In his Rolling Stone interview in 1980 , Mr. Bush volunteered his abortion-rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival , Ronald Reagan .
In addition to supporting the landmark Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion , Mr. Bush said he opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that Mr. Reagan was promising to promote .
Now , some see Mr. Bush trapped in a position he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape .
Ken Ruberg , head of the Republican Mainstream Committee , a group of party moderates , observes : `` The administration finds itself in an ideological cul de sac that it will find it difficult -- if not impossible -- to get itself out of .
When we look closely at our own history , it is clear that our constitutionally mandated civil rights have evolved not through the goodness of people 's hearts but through legislation and constitutional amendments .

Analysts had mixed responses to the results .
Donald DeScenza , an independent analyst in New Canaan , Conn. , said he was `` impressed with the company 's performance . ''
However , Harry Millis , an analyst at McDonald & Co. , Cleveland , said Goodyear 's results `` fell at the bottom '' of his range of estimates .
Today , Mr. Corry presides over a company whose fortunes have changed abruptly .
Mr. Icahn , the company 's deep-pocketed , tenacious adversary , recently disclosed that he had raised his USX stake to 13.1 % , and he again threatened a takeover .
The burning question is whether the new chief can parry Mr. Icahn without being pushed into unwelcome moves .
Mr. Corry might have to dismember the company more than he wants to .
Yet , the unassuming Mr. Corry helped chart USX 's transition from Big Steel to Big Oil .
He served as Mr. Roderick 's front man in tense negotiations for the 1982 purchase of Marathon Oil for $ 5.9 billion .
Nevertheless , Mr. Corry , once named chief executive , did n't waste any time distancing himself from his former boss , who still has an office on the 62nd floor of the USX tower in Pittsburgh .
Soon after taking over last June , Mr. Corry rescinded a pay cut imposed on clerical workers , a move that Mr. Roderick had n't made in spite of improved earnings .
However , even USX executives who work closely with him are n't sure about his long-term goals .
`` I do n't think he has a clear sense of where he wants the company to go , '' one says .
`` It 's part of the capitalistic market system that equity can be bought and equity is bought , '' he said .
USX , he noted , was formed 88 years ago , `` by in effect buying out a bunch of other companies ... .

The Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery actually is a ministry for farmers and fishermen instead of a ministry of provisions .

Few people are aware that the federal government lends almost as much money as it borrows .
From 1980 to 1988 , while federal budget deficits totaled $ 1.41 trillion , the government issued $ 394 billion of new direct loans and an additional $ 756 billion of new primary loan guarantees .
But recent events indicate that federal credit is out of control .
Student loan defaults remain high at about 12 % , and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and mismanagement .
Given the structure of most credit programs , it is surprising that default rates are not even higher .
Guarantee rates are typically 100 % , giving lenders little reason to screen customers carefully .
Creative accounting is a hallmark of federal credit .
Many agencies roll over their debt , paying off delinquent loans by issuing new loans , or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans .
Some agencies simply keep bad loans on the books
as late as 1987 , the Export-Import Bank held in its portfolio at face value loans made to Cuba in the 1950s

For fiscal 1990 , analysts expect P&G 's sales to continue to grow , with earnings climbing between 15 % and 20 % .
Lynne Hyman , vice president of equity research for First Boston Corp. , expects P&G to post net of about $ 4.20 a share , on a post-split basis .
Because of his remarkable success turning around P&G 's international operations , analysts have high hopes for his tenure .

Cast as Violetta Valery in a new production of Verdi 's `` La Traviata , '' Ms. Gruberova last week did many things nicely and others not so well .

Worse , her walls move all the time -- at least in this production .

If a strike ever hits the Met , the company can still sell tickets to his `` Boheme '' and `` Turandot '' and boom out recordings -LRB- of another era -RRB- .
Last week 's discerning audience gave a bigger hand to a greenhouse than to the tenor Neil Shicoff , who sang an aria inside it .
In any event , Ms. Gruberova barely ventilated Violetta 's anguish in her long meeting with Wolfgang Brendel , who as Germont seemed fairly desperate trying to inject an Italianate lilt into his heavy , teutonic baritone .

Citing rising fuel costs , promotional fare cuts and a general slowdown in travel , several major carriers have posted or are expected to post relatively poor third-quarter results .
Yesterday , USAir Group Inc. , recently one of the industry 's stellar performers , posted a worse-than-expected $ 77.7 million net loss for the period .
In announcing the results , USAir cited many of the same problems that several other industry officials have named recently .
It said the industry 's domestic traffic was flat in the third quarter ; analysts say this was because hefty fare increases earlier in the year scared off many leisure travelers this summer .
Some other fare promotions have backfired .
This summer , the industry introduced a `` kids fly free '' program , in which children were allowed to fly free if they were traveling with an adult .
Airlines also say their frequent-flier programs are squeezing profits because awards are being redeemed at a heavier-than-normal rate .
One airline official said about three times as many free-travel coupons are being turned in as in previous years -- not surprisingly , as the airlines last year allowed many travelers to build up mileage at triple the normal rate .
Rising operating expenses are another problem .
Fuel costs were up 10 % in the third quarter .

There are also indications that the number of magazine entrepreneurs , traditionally depended upon to break new ground with potentially risky start-ups , are dwindling .
More than ever , independent magazines and small publishing groups are being gobbled up by larger publishing groups , such as American Express Publishing Corp. , a unit of American Express Co. , and Conde Nast Publications Inc. , a unit of Advance Publications Inc. , which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers .

Already last week , Mr. Krenz started overhauling East Germany 's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media .
On Thursday , a day after he took office , East German television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer .
Although Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades .
Unlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture people about socialist values , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions .
He was later shown on television , fielding questions .
At one point , he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies .
This same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting U.S. congressmen this spring .
Rather than trying to `` lecture us , '' says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting , Mr. Krenz `` wanted to listen . ''
The diplomat adds that Mr. Krenz has several things going for him .
The East German economy is strong compared with other East bloc nations .
Meanwhile , East Germany 's growing openness may even allow the state-controlled news media to display a muted sense of humor .
Television last week carried a new report on East Berlin 's main wallpaper factory and the need to boost production .
One reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements .
Typically , the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt .
Meanwhile , the photographic industry , which accounts for 44 % of silver consumption , continues to look for substitutes .
Japanese and U.S. photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and X-rays that do n't require silver , dealers say .
Meanwhile , total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row , he says .
Japanese demand grew by 70 % in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4.5 million ounces .
But these players were dead .
`` Maybe three years ago , there were a lot of -LCB- Ty -RCB- Cobbs in the hobby , and awhile back there were Babe Ruth checks , '' says Mr. Smalling .
However , the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way .
`` Maybe I 'm a little stuffy , but I would n't sell them , '' sniffs Bob Machon , owner of Papa 's Sports Cards in Menlo Park , Calif .
Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it .
Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock , but not for less than $ 55 .
Specific-Time Order : This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time .
`` On the close '' can be added to many types of orders .
Remember , though , that beta also has important limitations .
`` Beta is only part of the risk in a stock , '' says William F. Sharpe , the Stanford University emeritus professor who developed the measure .
Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses I 've invested in during this prosperous decade -LRB- see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 20 , 1989 -RRB- .
Oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985 , at which point the industry , while not lighting up any Christmas trees , began a slow recovery .
With this personal strategy firmly in place , I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage .
My kids ' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending , although I 'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it .
An admittedly limited survey by NASAA , whose members are state securities-law regulators , found that between 1986 and 1988 `` fraud and abuse '' by financial planners cost 22,000 investors $ 400 million .
The rogues ' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons , a compulsive gambler or two , various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy , and one man who scammed his wife 's grandmother .
An estimated 10 million Americans are now using financial planners , and the pool of capital they influence is enormous .
A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of $ 154 billion of their clients ' money in the previous 12 months .
The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult , if not impossible , to regulate .
Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as `` investment advisers '' -- people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically -- have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity .
The proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with .
Mr. Schwartz , the puckish planner from Englewood , Colo. , says that allowing the business to police itself would be `` like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank . ''
Nothing seems hard here .
The breezes are soft , the waves lap gently and the palm trees sway lazily .
Moreover , ostentation is appreciated .
The median price of homes is $ 547,000 ; more than 9,000 vessels fill what the chamber of commerce calls the nation 's largest pleasure-boat harbor .
Newport Beach operations differ from the Hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars .
Traditionally , boiler rooms operate on the cheap , since few , if any , customers ever visit their offices .
The Newport Beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately .
Investigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine , who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp. , which promised investors returns of as much as 625 % on precious metals .
All this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city 's legitimate business element .
Vincent M Ciavarella , regional manager of Property Management Systems , insists he does n't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6 million square feet of office space around Fashion Island that his company leases for Irvine Co. , the owner and developer of the project .
The latest wave of marketing is instructive .
Several outfits -- including the Financial Programs , Franklin , and T. Rowe Price mutual-fund groups and the Edward D. Jones brokerage house -- are advertising `` college planner '' tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly .
The figures are shocking .
To build a nest egg that would pay for Stanford when a current first-grader reaches college age , parents would need to set aside $ 773.94 a month -- for 12 years .
Plugging a cheaper college into the formulas still does n't generate an installment most people can live with .
Using a recent average private-school cost of about $ 12,500 a year , T. Rowe Price 's planner prescribes $ 450 monthly if the plan begins when the child is six .
Not everyone is so pessimistic .
`` People are basically peddling a lot of fear , '' says Arthur Hauptman , a consultant to the American Council on Education in Washington .
Parents , he says , should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford .
Half the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal , he adds .
In their anxiety , however , parents and other student benefactors are flocking to new schemes .
They have laid out about $ 1 billion for so-called baccalaureate zero-coupon municipal bonds -- so far offered by Connecticut , Illinois , Virginia and eight other states .
Their compounding effect is also alluring .
In June , Virginia sold bonds for $ 268.98 that will pay $ 1,000 in 2009 .
Many openings for mass cheating , such as questionable tax shelters and home offices , have gaped so broadly that Congress has passed stringent laws to close them .
Deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied by appraisals .
But what we may not know is just what makes somebody a sucker .
What makes people blurt out their credit-card numbers to a caller they 've never heard of ?
`` Once people got into it , I was allowing them to live a dream , '' he says .
He phoned them with updates on the investment , such as `` funny things that happened at the well that week , '' he says .
`` The trappings of success go a long way -- wearing the right clothes , doing the right things , '' says Paul Andreassen , an associate professor of psychology at Harvard .
Conservative appearances make people think it 's a conservative investment .
Often con artists will try to disarm their victims by emphasizing similarities between them .
William Lynes , a retired engineer from Lockheed Corp. , says he and his wife , Lily , warmed to the investment pitches of a penny-stock peddler from Stuart-James Co. in Atlanta after the broker told them he , too , had once worked with Lockheed .
Over the past decade or two , while I was thinking about fox hunting , the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products , variations on products , and variations on the variations .
Besides term life and whole life -LRB- the old standbys -RRB- , we now have universal life , universal variable life , flexible adjustable universal life , policies with persistency bonuses , policies festooned with exotic riders , living benefit policies , and on and on .
Hugely popular , it is far more flexible than straight whole life .
I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment ; I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year ; and I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy .
By afternoon , the broader market joined the advance in full strength .
Standard & Poor 's 500-stock Index rose 5.37 to 347.13 and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 7.52 to 470.80 .
Traders said a variety of factors triggered the rally .
The consumer price index rose 0.2 % in September , while many economists were looking for a 0.4 % increase .
But some traders thought there was less to the rally than met the eye .
`` There is no strength behind this rally , '' asserted Chung Lew , head trader at Kleinwort Benson North America .
That approach flopped
Last Christmas Day , a USAir Group Inc. DC-9 jetliner flew about seven passengers from Chicago to Pittsburgh
So this year , the airlines are getting a jump on holiday discounts .
They are cutting ticket prices by as much as 70 % from normal levels for travel to most U.S. locations on Dec. 24 , 25 , 29 , 30 and 31 , and Jan. 4 , 5 and 6 .
That irritates many women who have n't taken their husbands ' last name .
`` What a bunch of nonsense , '' says Jessica Crosby , president of the New York chapter of the National Association of Women Business Owners .
But gay rights advocates are angry , too .
The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund of New York City has received complaints from homosexual couples whom the airline does n't recognize as family .
It also opened the door to furs made in South Korea , China , Hong Kong and other countries .
Jindo Furs , a large South Korean maker , says it operates 35 retail outlets in the U.S. and plans to open 15 more by the end of next year .
Other furriers have also benefited from leathers .
Seymour Schreibman , the 65-year-old owner of Schreibman Raphael Furs Inc. , treats the reverse side of a Persian lambskin to produce a reversible fur-and-leather garment .
Mr. Rosen is also pushing retail sales .
This year he bought two stores , one in Brooklyn and one in Queens .
But even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump , fear that furs are losing part of their allure .
`` People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business , '' says Stephen Sanders , divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field 's department store in Chicago .
In reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound , Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy .
He said he monitors the money-supply figures , but does n't give them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested .
Leading up to the speech was a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting that the British war on inflation will be more bruising than previously assumed .
Unemployment in September dropped to 1,695,000 , the lowest level since 1980 .
But not every company expects to report increased earnings .
C.R. Bard Inc. yesterday said third-quarter net plunged 51 % to $ 9.9 million , or 18 cents a share , from $ 20 million , or 35 cents a share , a year earlier .
But other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth .
`` This is a good move , but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are , '' in terms of earnings growth , said Joel D. Gross , an analyst with Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette .
Strategies vary for Westridge Capital , which has $ 300 million under management .
The firm sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks , and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies .
These guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains .
Here a fund may promise to pay back , say , $ 95 of every $ 100 invested for a year , even if the market goes much lower .

Now , the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension , bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion-rights forces .
A recent pro-choice rally in Trenton drew thousands , and in a major reversal , Congress is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest .

No age group is more sensitive than younger voters , like Ms. Ehman .
A year ago this fall , New Jersey voters under 30 favored George Bush by 56 % to 39 % over Michael Dukakis , according to a survey then by Rutgers University 's Eagleton Institute .
Even abortion opponents , however angry with Mr. Florio , ca n't hide their frustration with the Republican 's ambivalence .
`` He does n't want to lead the people , '' says Richard Traynor , president of New Jersey Right to Life .
The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. Courter 's fortunes , but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate , pro-choice Gov. Kean .
While the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government , anti-tax agenda in Washington , Gov. Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey 's budget in his eight years in office .
Fluent in Spanish from his days in the Peace Corps , Mr. Courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head .
He is warm and polished before a Puerto Rican Congress in Asbury Park .
Yet minutes after promising to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government , he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office .
Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter 's team , and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean , mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s .
Appealing to a young audience , he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead .
Mr. Florio 's forcefulness on the abortion issue after the Webster ruling divides some of his old constituency .
Pasquale Pignatelli , an unlikely but enthusiastic pipe major in an Essex County Irish bagpipe band , speaks sadly of Mr. Florio .
Still , some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind .
`` It increasingly appears that 1987-88 was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem , '' argued Edward Yardeni , chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York .
In its new ad campaign , created by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles Inc. , Chicago , the ski industry is trying to change its image as a sport primarily for young white people .
One 60-second TV spot features a diverse group of skiers gracefully gliding down sun-drenched slopes : senior citizens , minorities , families with children -- even a blind skier .
Many resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business .
Since 40 % of skiers are parents , many slopes are building nurseries , expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids .

This seems to be happening now to limited partnerships , many of which either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been grievous disappointments .
And some movies seem to have been hurt by their inattention .
Warner executives blame Mr. Guber 's and Mr. Peters 's lack of involvement in `` Caddyshack II '' for casting and production problems and the film 's ultimate dismal failure .
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters rub many people in Hollywood the wrong way .
Producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer , who shepherded `` Flashdance '' through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie , bristle when Messrs. Guber and Peters take credit for the film .
The two `` have a wonderful chemistry -- Jon is very impulsive , and Peter is very compulsive , '' adds Mr. Birnbaum , who is now head of production at News Corp. 's 20th Century Fox Film Co .
`` Jon Peters will come barreling into a room , say he 's got a great idea , and be gone .
Peter will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific ... . ''
While Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others , their record was n't always so impressive .
Among their clinkers were `` The Legend of Billie Jean , '' `` VisionQuest , '' `` Clue '' and `` Clan of the Cave Bear . ''
And earnings have been erratic .
In the the latest quarter , thanks in part to `` Batman , '' Guber Peters earned $ 5.8 million , or 50 cents a share , compared to a loss of $ 6.8 million , or 62 cents a share , in last year 's quarter .
And they say there are plenty of precedents in Hollywood for letting people out of contracts .

The collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials .
Gov. George Deukmejian , who said he had been assured by state transportation officials that the structure could withstand an even larger quake , called for an immediate investigation .
The Cypress structure opened in June 1957 , and as such , like many buildings in the San Francisco Bay area , does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support .
The northern piers of the span lie in estuarian deposits that were of a type to have liquefied easily during the 1906 quake .

At the same time , newspapers are bedeviled by lagging national advertising , especially in its financial component .
Dow Jones & Co. recently reported net fell 9.9 % , a reflection , in part , of continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron 's magazine .
That news , plus recent signs of economic sluggishness , greatly increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease credit further , which in turn would be good news for stocks , investment managers say .

For the most part , major corporations ' headquarters and plants were unaffected or only slightly damaged by Tuesday 's earthquake , which registered 6.9 on the Richter scale .
One of the last big employers in the Silicon Valley to report in , Seagate Technology , said it expects to be back at full strength Monday .
The city 's recovery from the earthquake was uneven .
Banks indicated they were operating at greater than 90 % of their usual capacity , but a Nob Hill hotel said tourists had fled , leaving the previously full hotel with an 80 % vacancy rate .
The most extensive damage was in small towns near the quake 's epicenter , 80 miles south of San Francisco .

`` We still have our die-hard baseball fans , '' a spokesman said .
`` One lady from New York said she 's not going home until the -LCB- World Series -RCB- is over . ''
The usual problem with including communists in `` interim '' coalition governments is that their ideology and methods require they squeeze out everyone else .

And ad agencies insist that they do .
Stan Richards of Richards Group Inc. , Dallas , tells of the Texan who saw the agency 's tear-jerking commercial for First Gibraltar Bank F.S.B. -- complete with the state 's anthem -- and promptly invested $ 100,000 in the thrift 's CDs .

Brawls between union factions still erupt at Pemex installations .
The 61-year-old Mr. Guzman Cabrera takes such criticisms in stride .
`` This is n't a new kind of union leadership , it 's a new Mexico .
We 're no longer afraid of associating with private or foreign capital , '' he says .
Taming the union complements previous moves by the government to attract private investment in petrochemicals , which Mexico has been forced to import in large quantities in recent years .
In May , the government unveiled new foreign investment regulations that create special trusts allowing foreigners , long limited to a 40 % stake in secondary petrochemical companies , to own up to 100 % .
But Pemex 's courtship with private companies , and especially foreign ones , is controversial in a country where oil has been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were nationalized in 1938 .

A licensed government intellectual , Francis Fukuyama , recently announced in The National Interest that history is , so to speak , at an end since the course of human progress has now culminated in the glorious full stop of American civilization .
But there were enough promoters announcing the end of history -LRB- in this case suspension of normal laws of economic gravity -RRB- for society to continue shielding its eyes .
Mainstream economists and commentators , craning their necks up at the great pyramids of junk financing , swiveling their heads to watch the avalanche of leveraged buy-outs , claimed the end result would be a leaner , meaner corporate America , with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wall .
All along they have been noting the tremors and pointing out the underlying realities .

In contrast to previous estimates reckoning the default rate on junk bonds at 2 % or 3 % , a Harvard study published in April of this year -LRB- and discussed in a lead story in The Wall Street Journal for Sept. 18 -RRB- found the default rate on these junk bonds is 34 % .

Politics and economics conspired .
Japan and Europe , far more dependent on Mideast oil than the U.S. , would n't offend the Arabs or trade off their precious supplies .

Ivan Boesky , Dennis Levine , Martin Siegel , Victor and Steven Posner , and now Michael Milken and perhaps Leona Helmsley .
The glitzy office that Ivan Boesky vacated for a prison cell had previously contained commodity operators Marc Rich and `` Pinky '' Green , today fugitives from a potential century apiece of jail sentences .

Mr. Noriega might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of Panama 's dire economic situation , says Mr. Moss , but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression , and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement .
Perhaps most important , Mr. Noriega 's allies have intervened to encourage -- in some cases , to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne .
One Colombian drug boss , upon hearing in 1987 that Gen. Noriega was negotiating with the U.S. to abandon his command for a comfortable exile , sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name .
His chief advantage in the fight : his intimate knowledge of American ways and weaknesses .
Mr. Noriega often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the gringos , who have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation .
During his years in Chiriqui , however , Mr. Noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious .
Rodrigo Miranda , a local lawyer and human-rights monitor , recalls an intoxicated Noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th Zone Garrison headquarters in David , where he had his offices .
Mr. Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked , laughing at them and then retreating to his office .
But through this period , so far as the U.S. military was concerned , Mr. Noriega was a model recruit .
He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at Fort Gulick in Panama in July 1967 , according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details Mr. Noriega has since classified as secret .
Even at this early stage , drugs caused additional concerns .
During the Nixon administration , the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2 's connections to arrested drug traffickers .
An incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which Mr. Noriega might have maintained such influence with Washington -- by compromising U.S. officials .
Curtin Windsor , then the ambassador to Costa Rica , recalls being invited to Panama by Mr. Noriega 's brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and `` quiet , serious conversation '' on the Aswara Peninsula .
Yet , his political setbacks mounted .
Mr. Noriega was accused of ordering in 1985 the beheading of Hugo Spadafora , his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger Mr. Noriega on drug trafficking charges .

For harried public-land managers across the nation , the response is increasingly to shut the gates .
The state of California , following the lead of some regional parks , recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all hiking paths in state parks to mountain bicycles .
But the club still insists that public lands ought to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate the bikes wo n't injure the environment or other users .
`` I have a mountain bike , yet as a hiker I 've been run off the road by kids careening down a fire trail on them , '' says Gene Coan , an official at Sierra 's headquarters in San Francisco , echoing the concerns of many members .
To fight back , activists such as Mr. Langton are forming groups to lobby land managers over access issues and undertake education programs to show that the bikes can responsibly share trails .
Mr. Langton 's group , Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Association , mounted petition drives to help keep open certain Santa Monica Mountain trails designated for closing .
These groups have been trying to improve the mountain biker 's image

In preparation for the withdrawal , Moscow , Kabul and New Delhi signed two agreements for several hundred newly civilian Indian experts to replace some of the more visible Soviet military personnel .
Moreover , serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of Soviet forces .
Before his assassination in 1988 , President Zia of Pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh Soviet troops were being inserted into Afghanistan even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn .

He said the Chaos Computer Club , of West Germany , once managed to invade SPAN and do such things as change the value of pi , messing up some calculations .
Yet it is also axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature , and not to courts .
Beginning in the early 19th century , with U.S. v. Hudson and Goodwin , the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal , while well established in British law , would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers .
Gradually , however , lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point .

The Irish-Soviet aviation connection is alive and well here at Shannon Airport .
GPA is indeed talking about leasing Western planes to Aeroflot and even about buying Soviet-built Tupolev 204s .
`` Irish and Soviet people are similar , '' says Mr. Ovcharenko .
`` They look the same .
That is n't all .
Last year , the Irish airport authority , in a joint venture with Aeroflot , opened four hard-currency duty-free shops at Moscow 's Sheremetyevo Airport .

Not everyone , however , is at ease with office massage .
Three years ago , the Internal Revenue Service 's office in San Jose , Calif. , opened its doors to on-site massage .
And even though employees paid the bill , taxpayers grumbled .
Given such attitudes , some corporate masseurs prefer to go about their business quietly .
Russell Borner of Park Ridge , N.J. , says he has been working for the past year at a huge chemical and manufacturing concern in New York -- unbeknownst to the company 's executives .
Occasionally , all that 's needed is a little coaxing .
Elisa Byler , a St. Louis masseuse , won over officials at Emerson Electric Co. , a maker of electrical and electronic equipment , by providing documents and other articles trumpeting the therapeutic benefits of massage .
Despite the number of fans that office massage has won , some purists look down on it , arguing that naked , full-body rubs are the only way to go .

Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved .
The December contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $ 1.2745 .

Many other factors played a part in yesterday 's comeback .
The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity ; the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day .

Unlike two years ago , most of Japan 's major investors chose to sit this calamity out .

Many fund managers argue that now 's the time to buy .
Vincent Bajakian , manager of the $ 1.8 billion Wellington Fund , added to his positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb , Woolworth and Dun & Bradstreet Friday .
In an unusual move , several funds moved to calm investors with recordings on their toll-free phone lines .

She transforms her `` Bronx of the emotions , a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria '' into the `` Babylonian Bronx , '' a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue .
In the Babylonian Bronx , Jewish working-class people lived in drab , Soviet-style buildings `` glamorized '' with names like AnaMor Towers -LRB- after owners Anna and Morris Snezak -RRB- , whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks , friezes of Pompeii .
Little Lily , as Ms. Cunningham calls herself in the book , really was n't ordinary .
She was raised , for the first eight years , by her mother , Rosie , whom she remembers as a loving liar , who realigned history to explain why Lily 's father did n't live with them .
The games Bronx children played -LRB- holding kids down and stripping them , for example -RRB- seem tame by today 's crack standards , but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure .
`` Without official knowledge of sex or death , we flirted with both , '' she writes .
She analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements .
Her friend Susan , whose parents kept reminding her she was unwanted , slept on a narrow bed wedged into her parents ' bedroom , as though she were a temporary visitor .
Maybe Lily became so obsessed with where people slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting .
When Rosie died , her uncles moved in -- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements .

They painted the apartment orange , pink and white , according to her instructions .
Harry is now a 57-year-old writer , whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in Hollywood and New York seems quaintly out-of-synch .
Harry fondly remembers the `` old '' days of the early '70s , when people like his friend Travis would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what Travis was doing wrong .
Assuming that the market does n't head into a bottomless free fall , some executives think Friday 's action could prove a harbinger of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be abating .
`` This is a reaction to artificial LBO valuations , rather than to any fundamentals , '' said John Young , chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co. , whose shares dropped $ 3.125 to $ 48.125 .
A few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the Business Council , a group that meets to discuss national issues , were only too happy to personalize their criticism .
`` People wish the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs , do something about takeovers , do something about Donald Trump , '' said Rand Araskog , chairman of ITT Corp. , whose stock dropped $ 3.375 .
`` There is an unbelievable amount of space available , '' says Faith Consolo , senior vice president at Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc .

Hooker Corp. , parent of Bonwit Teller and B. Altman 's , is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and Bloomingdale 's is for sale by its owner , Campeau Corp .
New York retail rents still run well above the going rate in other U.S. cities .
Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $ 500 a square foot , and $ 250 is not uncommon .

Some in the industry are skeptical .
`` I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what , at least in the public 's mind , is the same news , '' says Reuven Frank , the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report .
That 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment , especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces .
`` They 've never shown any inclination to spend money on production , '' says Michael Mosettig , a senior producer with MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour , who notes that CNN is indispensable to his job .
`` We 're asking the court for a number of things he can grant in addition to the thrill of victory , '' he says .
`` We 'd take the Valley Ranch free and clear as a booby prize .
Attempts to produce `` pan-European '' programs have generally resulted in disappointment .
One annual co-production , the three-hour-long `` Eurovision Song Contest , '' featuring soft-rock songs from each of 20 European countries , has been described as the world 's most boring TV show .
The most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns .
A French knock-off of `` Dallas , '' called `` Chateauvallon '' and set in a French vineyard , had a good run in France , which ended after the female lead was injured in a real-life auto accident .
Now , however , commercial channels are coming to most European countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly .
Just last week , Greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time ; Spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels .
The financially struggling station offers programs obviously made available cheaply from its boss 's other ventures .
In a Madrid hotel room recently , a viewer caught the end of a badly acted series about a fishing boat on Australia 's Great Barrier Reef , only to be urged by the British announcer to `` stay tuned for the further adventures of Skippy the Kangaroo . ''

Many of the affluent are n't comfortable with themselves , either .
About 40 % do n't feel they 're more able than others .
But a majority of the Addison council did n't buy those arguments .
Introducing pool , argued Councilwoman Riley Reinker , would be `` dangerous .
Opponents of the cut are playing hardball .
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- said he was `` confident '' that any House-Senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation would n't include a capital-gains tax cut .
The Senate bill was stripped of many popular , though revenue-losing , provisions , a number of which are included in the House-passed bill .
These include a child-care initiative and extensions of soon-to-expire tax breaks for low-income housing and research-and-development expenditures .
He ticks off several major differences between now and two years ago .
Unlike 1987 , interest rates have been falling this year .
Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true .

But they are worried .
`` We were just starting to get the public 's confidence back , '' lamented Mr. Mullins of Dean Witter .
The issues of companies with ties to the junk bond market also tumbled Friday .
On the OTC market , First Executive , a big buyer of the high-risk , high-yield issues , slid 2 to 12 1\/4 .
Other money managers also opened their wallets .
`` I was buying at the close -LRB- Friday -RRB- and I 'll be buying again because I know we 're getting good value , '' said Frederick A. Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc. , Greenwich , Conn .
Even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were grim Friday , money managers said .
Neil Weisman , whose New York-based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85 % of its $ 220 million investment pool to cash in recent months , said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands .
During last week 's maneuverings on the deficit-cutting bill and the capital-gains issue , there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds .
At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it .
But some players were quick to seize the moment .
Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard Rahn , the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains .
Some evinced an optimism that had been rewarded when they did n't flee the market in 1987 .
`` Oh , I bet it 'll be up 50 points on Monday , '' said Lucy Crump , a 78-year-old retired housewife in Lexington , Ky .
Others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand .
`` We all assumed October '87 was a one-time shot , '' said San Francisco attorney David Greenberg .
But it 's not only the stock market that has some small investors worried .
Alan Helfman , general sales manager of a Chrysler dealership in Houston , said he and his mother have some joint stock investments , but the overall economy is his chief worry .
And , finally , there were the gloaters .
`` I got out in 1987 .
Everything , '' said Pascal Antori , an Akron , Ohio , plumbing contractor who was visiting Chicago and stopped by Fidelity Investments ' LaSalle Street office .
Compaq 's series of notebooks extends a trend toward downsizing in the personal computer market .
One manufacturer already has produced a clipboard-sized computer called a notepad , and two others have introduced even smaller `` palmtops . ''
Palmtops are n't far behind .
Atari Corp. 's Portfolio , introduced in Europe two months ago and in the U.S. in early September , weighs less than a pound , costs a mere $ 400 and runs on three AA batteries , yet has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs .
Compaq is already taking aim at Zenith 's market share .
Rod Canion , Compaq 's president and chief executive officer , notes pointedly that Zenith 's $ 2,000 MinisPort uses an `` unconventional '' two-inch floppy disk , whereas Compaq 's new machines use the more common 3 1\/2-inch disk .
Analysts do n't see it that way .
`` I ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is dynamite for Compaq and a stopper for everyone else , '' says Gene Talsky , president of Professional Marketing Management Inc .
Of course , many more issues -- 93 -- hit new lows .
These included International Business Machines Corp. , which during Friday 's session traded below $ 100 a share for the first time since June 1984 .
But some big brokerage firms said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls .
Margin calls since Friday `` have been higher than usual , but reasonable , '' a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said .
At the very least , the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation 's success in handling the last go-around .
As Sen. Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- observed yesterday , `` The Fed avoided a meltdown last time .
They are more sophisticated this time .
Still , some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains , largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals .
Du Pont Co. is thought to have had steady profit growth in white pigments , fibers and polymers .

For Himont Inc. , `` how far down it is , we do n't know , '' says Leslie Ravitz at Salomon Brothers .
In fact , few consume much of anything .
Two share a house almost devoid of furniture .
The seeds already are in the script .
The first episode concluded with a marvelously cute scene in which the trading-room crew minded a baby , the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm .
And many in the young cast bear striking resemblances to American TV and movie personalities known for light roles .
Joanna Kanska looks like a young Zsa Zsa Gabor ; William Armstrong , who plays Max , could pass for Hans Conreid , and Douglas Hodge -LRB- Declan -RRB- for James Farentino ; Rolf Saxon is a passable Tommy Noonan and Dorian Healy could easily double for Huntz Hall , the blank-faced foil of the Bowery Boys comedies .
Aside from GM , other car makers posted generally mixed results .
Ford Motor Co. had a 1.8 % drop in domestic car sales but a 2.4 % increase in domestic truck sales .
Indeed , Hungary is in the midst of a media explosion .
Boys on busy street corners peddle newspapers of every political stripe .
The competitive spirit is clearly influencing Radio Free Europe , which is trying to beef up programs .
The Budapest office plans to hire free-lance reporters to cover the latest happenings in Hungarian country towns from Nagykanizsa in the west to Nyiregyhaza in the east .
There 's also a host of new programs , trying to lighten up on the traditional diet of politics .
A daily 35-minute program called `` The March of Time '' tries to find interesting tidbits of lighthearted news and gossip from around the world .
And to attract younger listeners , Radio Free Europe intersperses the latest in Western rock groups .
The Pet Shop Boys are big this year in Budapest .
Thus , undoubtedly it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove contagious , infecting patriotic conservatives , pay-as-you-go moderates , and idealistic liberals .
The Democratic Leadership Council , a centrist group sponsoring the plan , surely thought it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents .
On the contrary , it is as robust as ever .
According to the Gallup Poll , American adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service , while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen 30 % -LRB- adjusted for inflation -RRB- .
At least 10 bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in Congress this spring .
One , co-sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn -LRB- D. , Ga . -RRB- and Rep. Dave McCurdy -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served .
Doctrine and special interests govern some responses .
People eager to have youth `` pay their dues to society '' favor service proposals -- preferably mandatory ones .
Then there are instinctive opponents .
To libertarians , mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money .
Let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion -- `` national service '' has no agreed meaning .
Would service be voluntary or compulsory ?
2 . `` Service '' should be service .
As commonly understood , service implies sacrifice .
People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve , but there are many ways for middle-class kids , and their elders , to serve at little public cost .
They can volunteer at any of thousands of non-profit institutions , or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers .
The reticence of federal officials was evident in the appearance Sunday of Budget Director Richard Darman on ABC 's `` This Week . ''
`` Secretary of the Treasury Brady and Chairman Greenspan and the chairman of the SEC and others have been in close contact .
I 'm sure they 'll do what 's right , what 's prudent , what 's sensible , '' he said .
But administration officials conceded that Friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week .
`` One possibility is that this is a surgical setback , reasonably limited in its breadth , and not a major problem , '' said one senior administration official , who also asked that he not be named .
`` The other is that we see another major disaster , like two years ago .
Panic selling also was unwise during other big declines in the past .
The crash of 1929 was followed by a substantial recovery before the great Depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began .
Indeed , some pros see Friday 's plunge , plus any further damage that might occur early this week , as a chance for bargain hunting .
`` There has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash , '' says Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc .
The official China Daily said retail prices of non-staple foods have n't risen since last December but acknowledged that huge government subsidies were a main factor in keeping prices down .
The State Statistical Bureau found that more than 1 billion yuan -LRB- $ 270 million -RRB- was spent in the first half of the year for pork subsidies .
Since then , life has changed a lot for 61-year-old Leonard Kaye , Justin 's owner .
`` I have n't been able to get a decent night 's sleep since this has been going on , '' he says .
Worse , Congress has started to jump on the Skinner bandwagon .
James Oberstar , the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the American and United Air Lines bids .
Also , traders are in better shape today than in 1987 to survive selling binges .
They are better capitalized .
But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help PASOK regain power , Mr. Papandreou should never be underestimated .
First came his predictable fusillade : He charged the Coalition of the Left and Progress had sold out its leftist tenets by collaborating in a right-wing plot aimed at ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in Greece .
The Boeing strike is starting to affect airlines .
America West said Friday it will postpone its new service out of Houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from Boeing .
And banks appear to be taking an increasingly skeptical view of requests for high-risk takeover loans .
The group trying to buy UAL announced Friday that it could n't arrange the $ 7.2 billion in bank loans it needs to buy the parent of United Airlines for $ 300 a share .
Hilton officials said they were n't worried about the drop in the company 's stock .
William Lebo , Hilton 's general counsel , said plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are `` on track '' for what has been described previously as `` a slow and deliberate process . ''
In other words , real-estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , plummet much further than a local economy in recession .
This was seen in the late 1960s in Los Angeles and the mid-1970s in New York .
Metropolitan Houston 's economy did drop and then flatten in the years after its 1982 peak .
In the mid-1980s , employment was down as much as 5 % from the 1982 peak and retail sales were off 13 % .
By some measures , metropolitan Denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years .
Its population has continued to increase since 1983 , the peak year of the economic cycle .
In a self-fulfilling prophecy , therefore , the region 's real-estate market all but collapsed in recent years .
Housing building permits are down more than 75 % from their 1983 peaks .
Sen. Cranston , who had already volunteered his help to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in any investigation of Mr. Keating , portrayed his role in 1987 as prodding regulators to act .
`` Why did n't the Bank Board act sooner ? '' he said .
Hong Kong trade figures illustrate the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border .
In 1988 , exports of domestically produced toys and games fell 19 % from 1987 , to HK$ 10.05 billion -LRB- US$ 1.29 billion -RRB- .
But re-exports , mainly from China , jumped 75 % , to HK$ 15.92 billion .
In the meantime , as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites , they are focusing mainly on Southeast Asia .
Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in Thailand , including Matchbox , Wah Shing and Kader Industrial Co. , the toy manufacturer headed by Mr. Ting .
Many of the toy makers ' problems started well before June 4 as a result of overstrained infrastructure and Beijing 's austerity programs launched late last year .
Toy makers complain that electricity in Guangdong has been provided only three days a week in recent months , down from five days a week , as the province 's rapid industrialization has outstripped its generating capacity .
Analysts , who were expecting Alcoa to post around $ 2.70 to $ 3 a share , were surprised at the lackluster third-quarter results .
`` It 's disappointing , '' said William Siedenburg , an analyst with Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co .
Such proclamations leave network officials all the more doubtful that the studios will bend .
`` They do n't seem to have an incentive to negotiate , '' says one network executive .
But recent developments have made the networks -- and NBC President Robert Wright , in particular -- ever more adamant that the networks must be unshackled to survive .
The latest provocation : Sony Corp. 's plan to acquire Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $ 3.4 billion , and to buy independent producer Guber Peters Entertainment Co. for $ 200 million .

Japan is going on a capital-spending binge that could make its trade surpluses even harder to shrink .
Its capital spending is growing at double-digit rates for the second year in a row , and its superefficient producers of everything from cars to computer chips are rushing to expand capacity , modernize factories and develop new products .
`` The boom 's so huge , '' says Mitsuru Saito , an economist at Sanwa Research Institute , ``it makes you think of the Golden '60s , '' when Japan developed rapidly .
The more factories and robots Japanese manufacturers add , the more they will be able to export , and the less their domestic customers will need to import .
At Canon Inc. , for example , sales are up nearly 20 % this year ; so , the maker of cameras and computer printers is doing what any Japanese company would do under the circumstances : It is increasing capital spending -- by 60 % .
It is building , among other things , a new laser-beam-printer factory in western Japan that can produce up to 150,000 printers next year .
Some 70 % of them are to be exported to the U.S. .
Even companies in smokestack industries wrestling with world-wide overcapacity are joining the boom .
Japan 's steelmakers are raising capital spending 22 % this year to $ 4.8 billion .
Hitachi Zosen Corp. , a shipbuilder buried in debt just a few years ago , will build a machinery plant , its first expansion in 14 years .
So big ICH is the capital-spending boom that Japanese companies ' outlays in Japan topped American companies ' domestic outlays by $ 521.4 billion to $ 494.8 billion in the 12 months ended March 31 even though Japan 's total output of goods and services is less than two-thirds America 's .
From a financial standpoint , the boom could n't come at a better time .
Many Japanese companies expect record profits this fiscal year , and Japanese interest rates , though up a bit recently , are still low .
And in a business system where shareholders have few rights and expect only modest dividends , companies can plow their profits back into plant and equipment .
But some economists and government officials here are n't applauding .
They fear that the boom may be too big for Japan 's or anyone else 's good .
`` It 's an explosive cocktail '' thrown at the world , says Kenneth Courtis , senior economist at the Tokyo unit of Deutsche Bank Group .
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is so concerned that it recently took the unusual step of urging Japanese auto companies to exercise caution in capital spending .
MITI officials hope to avoid yet-another source of trade friction with the U.S. even though export restraints currently limit Japanese car exports to the U.S. .
Not everyone is worried , however .
Some economists -- and many Japanese companies -- are puzzled by the warnings .
The investment boom is mainly sparked , they say , by strong domestic demand and is n't likely to increase exports sharply .
Moreover , much investment is n't aimed at increasing capacity .
According to a survey of some 2,400 large companies by the Japan Development Bank , expanded capacity is the goal of just 51.8 % of the outlays ; for manufacturers alone , the figure is 32 % .
The manufacturers said14.2 % of their spending is designed to improve products or add new ones , 17.5 % is to cut costs , 12.5 % is for research and development , and the rest is for maintenance and other purposes .
But the worriers remain unconvinced .
With Japan running enormous trade surpluses against much of the world , they think that Japan should meet the increased domestic demand by importing more .
And eventually , they contend , domestic demand will weaken , forcing companies to emphasize exports again .
`` If there 's a further drive to export , '' says Nobuyuki Arai , an economist at the Japan Development Bank , `` that 'll be a problem . ''
Even in the short run , the investment boom could exacerbate a disturbing trend : Japanese exports are showing surprisingly little tendency to ease .
Japanese auto makers , for example , are increasing their production capacity in the U.S. ; the additional production should , in part , replace imported vehicles with locally manufactured ones .
But although Japanese companies increased their U.S. auto output by 42 % from January to September compared with the year-earlier period , their exports to the U.S. will drop only 9 % this year , Nikko Research Center estimates .
In contrast to previous economic booms , Japanese auto companies are n't just trying to boost production .
Many are pouring money into developing high-quality products to target affluent consumers and , to some extent , to avoid direct combat with cheaper cars from South Korea and Taiwan .
Others are replacing older facilities with flexible assembly lines on which different models can be turned out at once .
So many companies ICH are investing in high-tech machinery that Fanuc Ltd. , a robot maker , also had to build a new plant .
The buildup is `` making Japan clearly more efficient , more technologically advanced and more competitive , '' declares a Western diplomat in Tokyo .
But whatever its effects on exports and imports , Japan 's investment boom during the past two years has been stimulated at least partly by soaring domestic demand .
Japan 's marathon economy , growing at 4.3 % this year , is now in its 35th month of expansion , and some economists are betting that the boom will outlast the record 57-month expansion in the late 1960s .
Japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money , especially on high-priced goods such as 29-inch television sets and luxury cars .
Nissan Motor Co. 's domestic auto sales are up 20 % this year largely because its expensive Cima , Sylvia and Cefiro models are in heavy demand .
`` One dealer told me that if he had more cars , he 'd sell them right away , '' says Takuro Endo , Nissan executive vice president .
He adds that the company is trying to keep up with demand `` by overworking '' its employees .
Similarly , Honda Motor Co. 's sales are so brisk that workers grumblethey have n't had a Saturday off in years , despite the government 's encouragement of more leisure activity .
With demand growing and workers in short supply , many Japanese manufacturers are spending heavily on automation .
Among them are the shipbuilders , which had halved their shipyard work forces to cut costs during a prolonged slump in demand but now are capturing an increased share of the strengthening global market .
Sasebo Heavy Industries Co. , a medium-sized shipbuilder , expects its sales to increase 30 % this year , largely because of rising demand for oil tankers .
Once one Japanese company steps up its investments , the whole industry follows .
Because most businesses put market share above profitability , to let a competitor 's addition to capacity go unmatched is to concede defeat .
The emphasis on market share is evident at Daikin Industries Ltd. , Japan 's biggest maker of industrial air conditioners .
Seeing new office buildings sprout up and its sales soar , Daikin is building another plant , which will lift its production capacity 50 % .
The expansion is aimed not just at meeting demand but also at expanding the company 's market share to 30 % from 27 % currently .
Besides , Daikin 's major competitors , Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. , `` are all adding production lines , '' a Daikin spokesman says .
`` Until now , we were trying to increase productivity with the facilitieswe already had .
But we ca n't produce enough anymore . ''
The competition is even more heated in the auto industry , where companies are racing one another in a world-wide market .
Nissan aims to expand its 25 % share of the market to 30 % by spending $ 141 million on a plant in southern Japan that could make as many as 240,000 cars a year .
Meanwhile , Toyota Motor Corp. 's $ 247 million buildup is increasing its annual capacity by 180,000 cars , and Honda is spending $ 317 million on expansion .
Mazda Motor Corp. is still considering its options , but it boldly aims to double its annual domestic sales to 800,000 cars in the next four years .
Those who are n't worried about how Japanese manufacturers ' investments will affect trade note that many new products are n't replacements for imports .
Although imports account for less than 1 % of beer sales in Japan , Asahi Breweries Ltd. , which has been gaining share with its popular dry beer , plans to fend off Japanese competitors by pouring $ 1.06 billion into facilities to brew 50 % more beer .
But new-product development will make Japanese companies stronger , and big investments in `` domestic '' industries such as beer will make it EXP even tougher for foreign competitors to crack the Japanese market .
Moreover , much of the investment boom is in high-tech fields in which Japanese companies have only limited foreign competition ; so , more investment practically assures more exports .
Toshiba Corp. , for example , is spending $ 986 million on two new plants to build four-megabit dynamic random access memories , the next generation of computer chips .
The product is n't widely used yet , but Toshiba , which has already beaten everyone else in producing the current-generation one-megabit DRAMs , believes that its early investment will heighten its chances of beating its competitors again .
`` It EXP 's important to gain leadership , '' a Toshiba spokesman says .
Meanwhile , Toshiba 's Japanese rivals , Hitachi , Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp. , are n't sitting still .
After doubling production in one plant , NEC is spending $ 275 million to build another plant that , in two years , will be able to make a million four-megabit DRAMs a year .
The new chip plants `` wo n't be excessive investment , '' says Hajime Sasaki , an NEC vice president .
`` We have enough products to make and the markets to sell these products . ''
Some of Japan 's goods being produced as a result of the investment boom are already successful overseas .
Toyota 's $ 35,000 Lexus automobile , a luxury model that it started shipping to the U.S. only last month , is racking up orders at a time when U.S.-made luxury-car sales are slow .
Toyota plans to raise Lexus exports when a new plant starts up next year .
What if its sales weaken someday ?
Japanese companies have a caveat competitor attitude .
If excess capacity develops , they say , not everyone will suffer .
The losers will be those with the least attractive products , and many of them , analysts think , will be foreign companies .
If Japanese companies are so efficient , why does Kawasaki-Rikuso Transportation Co. sometimes need a week just to tell its clients how soon it can ship goods from here to Osaka ?
Why , until last spring , did the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan sometimes take several days to correct typographical errors in its paper work for international transactions ?
Because the companies have lacked office computers considered standard equipment in the U.S. and Western Europe , Japanese corporations ' reputation as hi-tech powerhouses is only half right .
Their factories may look like sets for a Spielberg movie , but their offices , with rows of clerks hunched over ledgers and abacuses , are more like scenes from a Dickens novel .
Now , the personal-computer revolution is finally reaching Japan .
Kawasaki-Rikuso , a freight company , set up its own software subsidiary this year and is spending nearly a year 's profit to more than double the computer terminals at its main office .
In April , the Long-Term Credit Bank linked its computers in Tokyo with its three American offices .
Overall , PC sales in Japan in the first half of 1989 were 34 % higher than in the year-earlier period .
Combined PC and work-station use in Japan will jump as much as 25 % annually over the next five years , according to some analysts , compared with about 10 % in the U.S. .
And with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency , more and more Japanese companies are concluding that they have no choice .
`` We have too many people in our home offices , '' says Yoshio Hatakeyama , the president of the Japan Management Association .
`` Productivity in Japanese offices is relatively low . ''
With Japanese companies in a wide range of industries -- from heavy industry to securities firms -- increasing their market share world-wide , the prospect of an even more efficient Japanese economic army may rattle foreigners .
But it also offers opportunities ; Americans are well poised to supply the weapons .
Japan may be a tough marketfor outsiders to penetrate , and the U.S. is hopelessly behind Japan in certain technologies .
But for now , at least , Americans are far better at making PCs and the software that runs them .
After years of talking about selling in Japan , more and more U.S. companies are seriously pouring in .
Apple Computer Inc. has doubled its staff here over the past year .
Lotus Development Corp. has slashed the lag between U.S. and Japan product introductions to six months from three years .
Ungermann-Bass Inc. has a bigger share of the computer-network market in Japan than at home .
But the Japanese have to go a long way to catch up .
Typical is one office of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 's Machinery and Information Industries Bureau -- the main bureaucracy overseeing the computer industry .
`` Personal Computer '' yearbooks are lined up on nearly every desk , and dog-eared copies of Nikkei Computer crowd magazine racks .
But amid the two dozen bureaucrats and secretaries sits only one real-life PC .
While American PC sales have averaged roughly 25 % annual growth since 1984 and West European sales a whopping 40 % , Japanese sales were flat for most of that time .
Japanese office workers use PCs at half the rate of their European counterparts and one-third that of the Americans .
Moreover , Japanese offices tend to use computers less efficiently than American offices do .
In the U.S. , PCs commonly perform many tasks and plug into a broad network .
In Japan , many desktop terminals are limited to one function and ca n't communicate with other machines .
The market planning and sales promotion office of Nomura Securities Co. , for example , has more than 30 computers for its 60 workers , a respectable ratio .
But the machines are n't on employees ' desks ; they ring the perimeter of the large office .
Some machines make charts for presentations .
Others analyze the data .
To transfer information from one to the other , employees make printouts and enter the data manually .
To transmit charts to branch offices , they use a fax machine .
Meanwhile , a woman sitting next to a new Fujitsu terminal writes stock-market information on a chart with a pencil and adds it up with a hand calculator .
In an efficient setup , the same PC could perform all those tasks .
In the U.S. , more than half the PC software sold is either for spreadsheets or for database analysis , according to Lotus .
In Japan , those functions account for only about a third of the software market .
Machines dedicated solely to word processing , which have all but disappeared in the U.S. , are still more common ICH in Japan than PCs .
In the U.S. , one-fifth of the office PCs are hooked up to some sort of network .
In Japan , about 1 % are linked .
`` Computers here are used for data gathering , '' says Roger J. Boisvert , who manages the integrated-technologies group in McKinsey & Co. 's Tokyo office .
Some Japanese operations , such as securities-trading rooms , may be ahead of their American counterparts , he says , but `` basically , there 's little analysis done on computers in Japan . ''
Of course , simply buying computers does n't always solve problems , and many American companies have erred by purchasing technologythey did n't understand .
But healthy skepticism is only a small reason for Japan 's PC lag .
Various cultural and economic forces have suppressed demand .
Because the Japanese `` alphabet '' is so huge , Japan has no history of typewriter use , and so `` keyboard allergy , '' especially among older workers , remains a common affliction .
`` I have no experience before with such sophisticated machinery , '' says Matsuo Toshimitsu , a 66-year-old executive vice president of Japan Air Lines , explaining his reluctance before accepting a terminal in his office this summer .
While most American employees have their own private space , Japanese `` salarymen '' usually share large , common tables and rely heavily on old-fashioned personal contact .
Top Japanese executives often make decisions based on consensus and personal relationships rather than complex financial projections and fancy presentations .
And Japan 's management system makes it EXP hard to impose a single , integrated computer system corporatewide .
Besides , a computer processing the Japanese language needs a huge memory and much processing capability , while the screen and printer need far better definition to depict accurately the intricate symbols .
Until recently , much of the necessary technology has been unavailable or at least unaffordable .
Some analysts estimatethe average PC costs about 50 % more ICH in Japan than the U.S. .
But the complex language is n't the only reason .
For the past decade , NEC Corp. has owned more than half the Japanese PC market and ruled it with near-monopoly power .
With little competition , the computer industry here is inefficient .
The U.S. market , too , is dominated by a giant , International Business Machines Corp .
But early on , IBM offered its basic design to anybody wanting to copy it .
Dozens of small companies did , swiftly establishing a standard operating system .
That spurs competition and growth , allows users to change and mix brands easily , and increases software firms ' incentive to write packages because they can be sold to users of virtually any computer .
If a record industry lacked a common standard , Sony CD owners could listen to a Sony version of Madonna 's `` Like a Prayer '' but not one made for a Panasonic player .
That is the state of Japan 's computer industry .
NEC wo n't release its code , and every one of the dozen or so makers has its own proprietary operating system -- all incompatible with each other .
IBM established its standard to try to stop falling behind upstart Apple Computer , but NEC was ahead from the start and did n't need to invite in competitive allies .
Meanwhile , the big players have n't tried to copy the NEC standard .
Corporate pride as well as the close ties common among Japanese manufacturers help explain why .
Most rivals `` have a working relationship with NEC , often through cross-licensing of technology , '' the Japan Personal Computer Software Association noted recently .
`` They hesitate to market NEC-compatible machines ; NEC disapproves of such machines , and marketing one would jeopardize their relationship . ''
The result , according to many analysts , is higher prices and less innovation .
While tens of thousands of software packages using the IBM standard are available in the U.S. , they sayonly about 8,000 are written for NEC .
A year ago , Japan 's Fair Trade Commission warned NEC about possible violations of anti-monopoly laws for discouraging retailers from discounting .
In Japan , `` software is four to five years behind the U.S. because hardware is four to five years behind , because NEC is enjoying a monopoly , '' complains Kazuhiko Nishi , the president of Ascii Corp. , one of Japan 's leading PC-magazine publishing and software companies .
`` There are no price wars , no competition . ''
An NEC spokeswoman responds that prices are higher in Japan because customers put a greater emphasis ICH on quality and service than they do in the U.S. .
She adds that some technological advances trail those in the U.S. because the Japanese still import basic operating systems from American companies .
But the market is changing .
The government is funding several projects to push PC use .
Over the next three years , public schools will get 1.5 million PCs , a 15-fold increase from current levels .
In the private sector , practically every major company is setting explicit goals to increase employees ' exposure to computers .
Toyota Motor Corp. 's sales offices in Japan have one-tenth the computers per employee that its own U.S. offices do ; over the next five years , it is aiming for rough parity .
Within a year , Kao Corp. , a major cosmetics company , plans to eliminate 1,000 clerical jobs by putting on a central computer network some work , such as credit reports , currently performed in 22 separate offices .
By increasing the number of PCsit uses from 66 to 1,000 , Omron Tateishi Electronics Co. , of Kyoto , hopes not only to make certain tasks easier but also to transform the waythe company is run .
`` Managers have long been those who supervise their subordinates so orders would be properly acted on , '' a spokesman says .
`` But new managers will have to be creators and innovators ... and for that purpose it EXP is necessary to create an environment where information from both inside and outside the company can be reached easily , and also shared . ''
Meanwhile , more computer makers now are competing for the new business .
Seiko Epson Corp. , a newcomer to the industry , fought off a legal challenge and started selling NEC clones last year .
It has won about 15 % of the retail PC market .
Sony Corp. , which temporarily dropped out of the PC business three years ago , started selling its work station in 1987 and quickly became the leading Japanese company in that market .
In a country where elbow room is scarce , laptop machines will take a large portion of the industry 's future growth .
Toshiba Corp. busted open that sector this summer with a notebook-sized machine that retails for less than 200,000 yen -LRB- under $ 1,500 -RRB- -- one of the smallest , cheapest PCs available in the country .
Fujitsu Ltd. is lavishing the most expensive promotion campaign in its history -- including a 100,000-guest bash at Tokyo Dome -- for its sophisticated sound\/graphics FM Towns machine , which it advertises for everything from balancing the family checkbook to practicing karaoke , bar singing .
Many of the companies are even dropping their traditional independence and trying to band together to create some sort of standard .
Two years ago , most of the smaller makers joined under the Microsoft Corp. umbrella to adopt a version of the American IBM AT standard .
That has n't generated much sales , but this summer Microsoft rallied all the major NEC competitors to make their new machines compatible with the IBM OS\/2 standard .
A healthy , coherent Japanese market could also make it EXP far easier for Japanese companies to sell overseas , where their share is still minimal .
But it could also help American companies , which also are starting to try to open the market .
As with many other goods , the American share of Japan 's PC market is far below that in the rest of the world .
U.S. makers have under 10 % share , compared with half the market in Europe and 80 % at home .
Though no formal trade barriers exist , the Japanese computer industry is difficultfor outsiders to enter .
`` If it were an open market , we would have been in in 1983 or 1984 , '' says Eckhard Pfeiffer , who heads Compaq Computer Corp. 's European and international operations .
His company , without any major effort , sells more machines in China than in Japan .
Although it has opened a New Zealand subsidiary , it is still only `` studying '' Japan , the only nation that has n't adopted IBM-oriented specifications .
And because general retail centers such as ComputerLand have little presence in Japan , sales remain in the iron grip of established computer makers .
But the Americans are also to blame .
They long made little effort here .
IBM , though long a leader in the Japanese mainframe business , did n't introduce its first PC in Japan until five years after NEC did , and that was n't compatible even with the U.S. IBM standard .
Apple did n't introduce a kanji machine -- one that handles the Chinese characters of written Japanese -- until three years after entering the market .
Critics also sayAmerican companies charge too much .
Japan 's FTC saysit is investigating Apple for allegedly discouraging retailers from discounting .
But the U.S. companies are redoubling their efforts .
Apple recently hired its first Japanese president ICH , luring away an official of Toshiba 's European operations , as well as a whole Japanese top-management team .
Earlier this year , it introduced a much more powerful kanji operating system and a kanji laser printer .
IBM just last year started selling its first machine that could run in both Japanese and English and that substantially enhances compatibility with its American products .
`` It EXP may take five years to break even in Japan , '' says John A. Siniscal , who runs the Asia-Pacific office for McCormack & Dodge , a U.S. software company .
`` But it 's an enormous business opportunity .
Ralph Brown was 31,000 feet over Minnesota when both jets on his Falcon 20 flamed out .
At 18,000 feet , he says , he and his co-pilot `` were looking for an interstate or a cornfield '' to land .
At 13,000 feet , the engines restarted .
But knowing that mechanics would probably ground him for repairs , Mr. Brown skipped his stop in nearby Chicago and set course to get his load -- a few hundred parcels -- to the Memphis package-sorting hub on time .
Had he been a little less gung-ho , `` I 'd have gotten the thing on the ground and headed for the nearest bar , '' Mr. Brown says .
But he flies for Federal Express Corp. , perhaps the closest thing in corporate America to the Green Berets .
Federal 's employees work long hours and seem to thrive on the stress of racing the clock .
Like Mr. Brown , they sometimes go to surprising lengths to meet that overarching corporate goal : delivering the goods on time .
They are a tribute to Federal 's management which , since the company 's founding 16 years ago , has had its way with its work force -- an unusual feat in the contentious transportation industry .
That may soon change .
This month , Federal 's 2,048 pilots , including some 961 acquired along with Tiger International Inc. in February , will decide whether to elect the powerful Air Line Pilots Association as their bargaining agent .
The election , which would bring the first major union to Federal 's U.S. operations , has pitted new hires against devoted veterans such as Mr. Brown .
It has also rattled Federal 's strongly anti-union management , which is already contending with melding far-flung operations and with falling profits .
`` A union , sooner or later , has to have an adversary , and it has to have a victory , '' Frederick W. Smith , Federal 's chairman and chief executive , says with disdain .
`` In our formula , we do n't have any losers except the competition . ''
What managers really fear is that the pro-union movement could spread beyond the pilots .
Under federal transportation law , a government mediator is attempting to reconcile the melding of Tiger 's job classifications into Federal 's .
Depending on the outcome , the merged company may face union elections ICH this fall among airplane mechanics , ramp workers , stock clerks and flight dispatchers .
These groups constitute up to 10 % of its work force .
`` Unions would have a profound effect on the whole culture of the company , '' says Bernard La Londe , a professor at Ohio State University at Columbus and a Federal consultant .
That culture , carefully crafted by Mr. Smith , leaves little , if any , room for unions .
Since founding the company , the charismatic Vietnam vet , who is still only 46 years old , has fostered an ethos of combat .
Flights are `` missions . ''
Mr. Smith 's managers have , at times , been called `` Ho Chi Minh 's Guerrillas . ''
The Bravo Zulu award , the Navy accolade for a `` job well done , '' is bestowed on Federal 's workers who surpass the call of duty .
Competitors are known as the `` enemy . ''
To reinforce employees ' dedication , Mr. Smith pays well .
He also lets workers vent steam through an elaborate grievance procedure and , as a perk , fly free in empty cockpit seats .
He gives pep talks in periodic `` family briefings '' beamed internationally on `` FXTV , '' the company 's own television network .
And , with many of his 70,000 workers , Mr. Smith 's damn-the-torpedoes attitude has caught on .
James Cleveland , a courier who earned a Bravo Zulu for figuring out how to get a major customer 's 1,100-parcel-a-week load to its doorstep by 8 a.m. , considers himself far more than a courier .
`` We do n't just hand the customer the package .
That 's just the beginning , '' he says .
`` In essence , we run the show . ''
David Sanders , a longtime pilot , bristles at the mere suggestion that a union might tamper with his flight schedule .
`` This is America , '' he says .
`` Nobody has the right to tell me how much I can work . ''
Such attitudes have given Federal flexibility , not only to rapidly implement new technology but to keep its work force extraordinarily lean .
The company deliberately understaffs , stretching employees ' schedules to the limit .
But though couriers work as many as 60 hours a week during the autumn rush , they leave early during slack times while still being assured of a minimum paycheck .
Pilots , as well , routinely fly overtime to ensure that none are furloughed during seasonal lows .
The operational freedom has also given Federal a leg up on archrival United Parcel Service Inc. , the nation 's largest employer of United Brotherhood of Teamsters members .
UPS wo n't discuss its labor practices , but , according to Mr. Cleveland , a former UPS employee , and others , union work rules prohibit UPS drivers from doing more than carrying packages between customers and their vans .
Because UPS drivers are n't permitted to load their own vehicles at the depot , say these couriers , packages often get buried in the load and are delivered late .
Labor problems are the last thingMr. Smith needs right now .
Although the Tiger acquisition has brought Federal a long way toward becoming the global playerit wants to be , it also has brought problems .
It more than doubled Federal 's long-term debt to $ 1.9 billion , thrust the company into unknown territory -- heavy cargo -- and suddenly expanded its landing rights to 21 countries from four .
Federal , on its own , had n't been doing very well overseas .
It had hemorrhaged in its attempt to get into Asia , where treaty restrictions forced it to fly some planes half-empty on certain routes .
On routes to South America , the company had no backup jets to ensure delivery when planes were grounded .
In Europe , business suffered as Federal bought several local companies , only to have the managers quit .
These and other problems squeezed Federal 's profit margins last year to 8 % , down from more than 13 % annually in the first half of the decade .
Earnings have plummeted , too , in each of the past three quarters .
In the fiscal first period ended Aug. 31 , profit fell 54 % to $ 30.4 million , or 58 cents a share , mostly because of the Tiger merger , Federal says .
Federal 's stock price , however , has held up well , driven in part by the general run-up of airline stocks , analysts say .
Since trading as low as $ 42.25 a share in May , Federal 's shares have rallied as high as $ 57.87 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
They closed Friday at $ 53.25 , down 50 cents on the day .
There 's a certain irony in the fact that Federal Express faces its first union problems as a result of its Tiger purchase .
Tiger itself was founded by a band of gungho airmen who had airlifted supplies `` over the Hump '' from India to China during World War II .
In the early 1970s , Mr. Smith modeled his fledgling company on Tiger 's innovation of hub-and-spoke and containerized-cargo operations .
But from early on , Tiger 's workers unionized , while Federal 's never have .
Federal Express officials acknowledge mistakes in their drive overseas but sayit will pay off eventually .
Analysts expect Federal 's earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter ending Feb. 28 , when the company should begin benefiting from Tiger 's extra flights , back-up planes and landing rights .
Until then , they expect the cost of integrating the two carriers to continue crimping profits .
For now , the union issue is the most nettlesome of Federal 's Tiger problems , management believes .
Although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers , Mr. Smith does n't countenance what he considers insubordination .
When a large group of pilots once signed petitions opposing work-rule and compensation changes , he called a meeting in a company hangar and dressed them down for challenging his authority .
He then made most of the changes , pilots say .
That sort of approach , however , has n't worked since the addition of Tiger .
Its 6,500 workers , who had battled Tiger 's management for years over givebacks , were union members until the day of the merger , when most of their unions were automatically decertified .
Soon after the merger , moreover , Federal 's management asked Tiger 's pilots to sign an agreement stating that they could be fired any time , without cause or notice .
When the pilots refused , the company retracted it .
Mr. Smith angered Federal 's pilots , too .
In his haste to seal the deal with Tiger Chairman Saul Steinberg last August , Mr. Smith ignored a promise ICH that he had made to his own pilots three years ago : that any fliers acquired in future mergers would be `` end-tailed '' -- put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that determines work schedules , pay and career options .
The Tiger merger agreement stipulated that the lists be combined on the basis of tenure .
Mr. Smith is trying hard to allay the anger .
And even some pro-union pilots sayhis charisma and popularity among the many former military fliers could be tough to beat .
`` A lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against Fred Smith , '' says J.X. Gollich , a Tiger-turned-Federal pilot and union activist .
Mr. Smith and other top Federal executives have met with Tiger workers in Los Angeles , Ohio , New York , Alaska , Asia and Europe .
Recently , they have appeared every few weeks in talk-show type videos , countering pro-union arguments .
In one video , Mr. Smith defended his agreement to merge the pilot-seniority lists .
He saidMr. Steinberg had insisted that the merger talks move quickly .
Regulators , as well , might have quashed the deal if Tiger 's pilots had n't been protected , he said .
Furthermore , Mr. Smith added , `` our contract with our pilots says that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice .
It does n't give any particular group the ability to veto change . ''
Already , the fight has been costly .
The seniority-list controversy , along with the job-classification dispute , has been turned over to the mediator .
Meanwhile , the company is operating with two separate pilot groups and seniority lists , and that is costing Federal `` a big number , '' says James Barksdale , executive vice president and chief operating officer .
The issue has also cost Federal management a lot of good will among its old pilots .
`` They were willing to mistreat us because we had n't shown any moxie , any resistance , '' says William Queenan , a DC-10 pilot and 14-year Federal veteran .
Adds ICH John Poag , a 727 captain and past chairman of the company-sponsored Flight Advisory Board : `` They 've made all these magnanimous gestures to the Flying Tiger pilots , and for us , nothing . ''
Such animosity could prove pivotal in the union vote .
A large majority of the 961 former Tiger fliers support the union , according to a union study .
But though most of the 1,087 Federal pilots are believed opposed , it EXP is unclear just how much their loyalty to Mr. Smith has been eroded .
The fight has turned ugly and , among pilots at least , has shattered the esprit de corps that Mr. Smith worked so hard to build .
Anti-union pilots have held ballot-burning parties .
Some younger pilots saythey have had to endure anti-union harangues by senior pilots while flying across the country .
And for now , at least , the competition is n't the only enemy .
Barney Barnhardt , a 727 captain and leader of the pro-union forces , saidhe has received two anonymous death threats and been challenged to a fight with tire irons by a colleague .
`` The pilots are either for us or extremely against us , '' he says with a sigh .
Thousands of queue-hardened Soviets on Wednesday cheerfully lined up to get a taste of ``gamburgers,'' ``chizburgers'' and ``Filay-o-feesh'' sandwiches as McDonald's opened in the land of Lenin for the first time.
The world's largest version of the landmark American fast-food chain rang up 30,000 meals on 27 cash registers, breaking the opening-day record for McDonald's worldwide, officials said.
The Soviets, bundled in fur coats and hats, seemed unfazed, lining up before dawn outside the 700-seat restaurant, the first of 20 planned across the Soviet Union.
The crush of customers was so intense the company stayed open until midnight, two hours later than planned.
``I only waited an hour and I think they served thousands before me,'' said a happy middle-aged woman who works at an aluminum plant.
``And it was only 10 rubles for all this,'' she said.
``I'm taking it back for the girls at the factory to try''.
Big Macs were priced at 3.75 rubles and double cheeseburgers at 3 rubles _ about two hours' pay for a starting McDonald's staffer or the average Soviet, but much cheaper than other private restaurants that have sprung up recently.
The official exchange rate is $1.59 per ruble but foreign visitors can buy rubles for 16 cents each, about what the currency is worth on the black market.
Half the day's sales were donated to the Soviet Children's Fund, which provides medical care and assistance to orphans and disadvantaged children, Gary Reinblatt, senior vice president of McDonald's Canada, said from Toronto.
The restaurant, built by the company in a joint venture with the city of Moscow that began 14 years ago, brought to 52 the number of countries where McDonald's operates.
The previous opening-day record for sales was in Budapest, company officials said.
Besides its restaurants in the United States, the leading number of McDonald's are in Canada and Japan, the officials said.
Soviets got a first-hand look at such alien concepts as efficiency and fast, friendly service.
Normally dour citizens broke into grins as they caught the infectious cheerful mood from youthful Soviet staffers hired for their ability to smile and work hard.
Accordions played folk songs and women in traditional costumes danced with cartoon characters, including Mickey Mouse and Baba Yaga, a witch of Russian fairy tales.
One Muscovite, accustomed to clerks who snarl if they say anything at all, asked for a straw and was startled when a smiling young Soviet woman found him one and popped it straight into his drink.
For most customers, it was their first experience with a hamburger.
Sandwiches were served in the familiar bag marked with the golden arches, but were packed in wrappers bearing Cyrillic letters, approximating ``gamburger''.
They tried them one-handed.
They picked their sandwiches apart to examine the contents.
One young woman finally squashed her ``Beeg Mak'' to fit her lips around it.
``It tasted great''! a 14-year-old boy said.
``It's a lot different from a stolovaya,'' he continued with a smile, referring to the much cheaper but run-down dirty cafeterias that slop rice and fat or boiled sausage.
Under the sign of the golden arches, accented by the Soviet hammer-and-sickle flag, hundreds lined up for the long-awaited grand opening at 10 a.m. on Pushkin Square, reaching out excitedly for McDonald's flags and pins as the hamburger chain's army fulfilled the Soviet penchant for souvenirs with Western logos.
Publicity-conscious managers had the staff shout ``Good morning, America''! in English and Russian, for an American TV network.
McDonald's of Canada Chairman George Cohon, the man behind the deal, said many people were buying multiple orders and the restaurant served 15,000 to 20,000 people in just the first five hours of operation.
The restaurant limited purchases to 10 Big Macs per customer in hopes of preventing burger-scalping.
McDonald's built its own factory, including bakery, dairy, meat-processing plant and even potato storage yard, to provide its own guaranteed supplies in a country where up to 25 percent of the harvest rots en route to the consumer.
One McDonald's associate said the company wound up importing wooden crates from Finland for storing potatoes because ``when they went to build crates, they found there was no wood, and no nails.
They found you need a permit to buy nails.''
For the New York Philharmonic, it was supposed to be a night of Beethoven and Shostakovich.
The fates made it a night of Leonard Bernstein.
The official catalog of his works says Bernstein led 74 orchestras.
But this was HIS orchestra, and the musicians came to pay tribute to THEIR laureate conductor, who led them through 1,244 concerts during his 47-year association with the Philharmonic.
They let his music do the talking.
``Tonight's concert is not an evening in which we want to dwell on the passing of a giant, but rather what he has left us,'' guest conductor Leonard Slatkin told the audience at Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday night.
So four nights after Bernstein's death at age 72, Beethoven's ``Violin Concerto'' became Bernstein's ``Serenade for Solo Violin, String Orchestra, Harp and Percussion'' (1954); Shostakovich's ``Symphony No. 4'' became Bernstein's ``Symphony No. 1 (Jeremiah),'' written in 1942.
Also added were his ``Chichester Psalms'' (1965) and his overture to ``Candide'' (1956).
The substitute Bernstein program was being repeated Friday night, Saturday and Tuesday.
It was an extraordinary concert.
There weren't many smiling faces among the audience or musicians.
Slatkin's brief introductory comments, followed by the whimsical ``Candide,'' broke some of the tension.
Then came the eclectic ``Serenade,'' which Bernstein's program notes says is supposed to be based on Plato's ``Symposium''.
It begins with a lyrical praise of the Eros, the god of love.
The piece is sometimes jocular, sometimes melancholy, sometimes assaulting and sometimes hedonistic.
It ends in drunken revelry, an intrusion of jazz - as if Bernstein was looking down from heaven and telling the audience, ``It's O.K. to smile tonight''.
The soloist - concertmaster Glenn Dicterow - played with much agility, especially through the difficult double stops and especially considering the lack of preparation time.
The mourning returned after intermission, but not without optimism.
``Jeremiah'' begins with suspenseful strings, followed by a cantorial French horn, a melodic return to the strings and then a prophetic blaring of brass.
The second movement continues the point-counterpoint of brass versus strings (Jeremiah versus the corrupt priests, with Nebuchadnezzar looming on the horizon).
In the third movement, Jerusalem has fallen to the Babylonian king.
Judea is exiled.
Jeremiah weeps.
``How she sits desolate - ``The city once so full of people - ``She is become as a widow''.
During her chanting of the prophet's ``Lamentations,'' mezzo-soprano Wendy White had to wipe a tear from her eye.
S did members of the audience.
Last on the program was another Hebraic elegy, ``Chichester Psalms''.
The New York Choral Artists and a boy soloist joined the orchestra.
Two harpists dominated the center of the crowded stage.
``Awake, psaltery and harp''! the choir begins in Hebrew.
``I will rouse the dawn''.
In the second movement an angelic 8th-grader, Evan Weber, sings King David's 23rd Psalm, ``The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want''.
After he finishes, the men's chorus bellows: ``Why do the nations rage''?
The piece, however, ends in a Mahlerian motif and chorus declaring a message Bernstein had sought for society: ``Behold how good, ``And how pleasant it is, ``For brethren to dwell ``Together in unity''.
To emphasize the point after the final note, Slatkin suspended his hands for several long moments of silence.
Then came the cascade of applause.
For Leonard Bernstein .
Hurricane Hugo struck South Carolina with renewed fury Thursday after thousands of coastal residents in southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on jammed highways.
``This is a disaster staring us right in the eye,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said from his City Hall command post in Charleston, where the hurricane downed power lines, snapped trees and caused utility transformers to explode.
``All we can do now is pray and hope all the precautions we have taken have been sufficient,'' Riley said as Hugo's eye bore in on the city.
``I just hope and pray we can get through this without any loss of life''.
By midnight, 119 mph winds were reported in Charleston.
The roof cracked at City Hall, a 188-year-old brick building that has withstood several hurricanes, and torrents of water poured into the paneled council chamber.
Phone and electric service to the command post was knocked out.
Hurricane-force winds first hit the coast by 9:15 p.m. EDT, and about three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the Isle of Palms just east of Charleston, said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
The eye was about 10 miles across and top winds were still at 135 mph. Hugo was expected to turn gradually to the north, causing severe flooding as it moved up the East Coast.
The storm posed a 19 percent chance of hitting New York City and a 16 percent chance of hitting Boston before Sunday night, the hurricane center said.
As Hugo neared the coast, roads from Hilton Head to Myrtle Beach, 200 miles north, were nearly empty, as were the boarded-up resort towns themselves.
Power lines and trees were downed in some spots and water flooded roads.
Stop lights and neon lights were knocked out in Myrtle Beach.
``One eyewitness said `It's like a light show,''' said Amy Garrison, a reporter at WKZQ AM-FM in Myrtle Beach.
In Charleston, the hurricane littered streets with tin roofs, palmetto fronds and chunks of bark.
Businesses were closed and classes at public schools and universities canceled.
Riley ordered residents of one-story homes to evacuate.
Hospitals stockpiled supplies, discharging any patients well enough to go and moving others to hospitals inland to make room for emergency patients, officials said.
About 12,000 people had checked into 83 shelters across the state as of Thursday evening, and more were expected, said Bennish Brown, a spokesman for the Emergency Operations Center in Columbia, 220 miles northwest of here.
``We tried to close the doors but people are sneaking in side doors,'' said Elaine Skelton, a registered nurse working at the Conway High School shelter near Myrtle Beach.
``We tried to post guards at the doors, but people were still coming in''.
American Red Cross relief efforts were buckling under the number of evacuees, said Brian Ruberry, a spokesman in Savannah, Ga., who appealed for help.
``Right now the Red Cross is sheltering tens of thousands of people all along the Eastern seaboard.
This of course is at the same time that we're sheltering 25,000 people on Puerto Rico and the other Caribbean islands.
``We're beginning to feel the squeeze.
Our resources are very tight.
Right now Hugo is shaping up to be one of our biggest relief operations of the decade''.
At midnight, the center of Hugo was near latitude 32.7 degrees north and longitude 79.9 degrees west, forecasters said.
The hurricane's speed had picked up to 22 mph from 20 mph earlier.
Near its center, Hugo's muscle reached winds of 135 mph, up from 125 mph earlier in the day and 105 mph the day before.
North and South Carolina can expect tornadoes linked to Hugo for the next two days, according to the hurricane center.
The coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for 10 to 12 hours once the eye comes ashore, officials said.
A hurricane warning was in effect between Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C.
By late afternoon, Hugo was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of strength, the second mightiest category, which indicated it could cause extreme damage.
``It strengthened more than we thought it would,'' Sheets said, adding that Hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up the Appalachians.
The timing of the landfall was critical because of the storm's tidal surge, a dome of water 10 to 15 feet high that would feed a normal 5-foot high tide that peaks after 2 a.m.
``On top of that will be waves,'' Sheets said earlier, and in many places on barrier islands ``the buildings will be swept clean off.''
Here is a state-by-state summary of drought developments Wednesday:
The Alabama National Guard is still hauling up to 25,000 gallons of water a day to 10 communities across the state despite recent rains.
At the height of the drought last month, the Guard was hauling water to 12 locations.
The Guard's water-hauling program has been in continuous operation since last July in west-central Alabama because of a low water table .
In an effort to help Georgia farmers locate hay, the state Department of Agriculture announced it will start compiling a list of sources.
Commissioner Tommy Irvin urged those with a surplus for sale to contact the department.
He said information will be compiled and updated regularly .
State Treasurer Jerry Cosentino announced a program to provide drought-stricken farmers with access to commercial loans with below-market interest rates.
The treasurer's office will commit $50 million to banks at a lower-than-normal interest yield and in turn those banks will offer farmers loans with rates as low as 10 percent.
``I know what the farmers first need is rain but that is out of our hands right now,'' Cosentino said.
``The next best thing they can get ...
would be additional funds to carry them over until next year.''
A group of Indiana farmers sued a New Jersey insurance company, saying the company acted in bad faith when it reneged on $2.5 million in drought insurance.
The lawsuit seeks an ``undeterminable'' amount of damages from Pio-Gard Agency of Ohio Inc. and Federal Insurance Co., a subsidiary of the Chubb Group Insurance Cos. of Warren, N.J .
Forecasters say Iowa's weather is returning to the hot, dry drought pattern which settled over the state for much of June .
The first emergency shipment of Oregon hay to help drought-stricken Kentucky farmers arrived, but logistical problems forced agriculture officials to delay its distribution until next week.
``It's a nightmare trying to find a fair way to do this,'' said Roger Nesbitt, a spokesman for the Kentucky Department of Agriculture.
Nesbitt said Wednesday's 20-ton shipment, flown free from Portland, Ore., by United Parcel Service, will be sold to farmers on Monday .
Heavy rain fell on some of the driest areas of central and east-central Minnesota, but it was ``way, way below what we should have, as far as precipitation goes,'' a National Weather Service hydrologist said.
``We need ...
a widespread distribution over a long period of time, say maybe 10 inches of rainfall to get us back to what we normally should be,'' Gary McDevitt said.
It was the heaviest rainfall for the east-central part of the state since April 26, when the area got about a half-inch of rain .
Weather experts say Mississippi could see above normal rainfall in the coming week.
Rainfall during the week ending Wednesday averaged 1 inch in some areas, with some extreme northern counties receiving greater amounts.
But the weather service said all Mississippi farm communities still had only 30 percent to 50 percent of normal moisture .
Road builders in the Kansas City area say the effects of dry weather in the Midwest this year are not all bad.
Engineers say several highway projects in the area will be open to traffic at least a month earlier than expected because of fewer interruptions caused by rain and wet weather. __
As many as 20 fires, sparked by lightning from thunderstorms, have blackened about 1,500 acres in the Custer National Forest.
The fires are being fought by from 150 to 200 firefighters.
A lightning-caused fire in the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area of northwest Montana was being allowed to burn naturally, officials said .
State Agriculture Director Roy Frederick said Nebraska farmers probably will have better crops than are expected nationwide and may benefit from higher prices.
Nebraska's outlook for the corn crop is rosier than national predictions because 75 percent of the corn comes from irrigated acres and Nebraska has received more rain than some other states, he said .
Gov. George Sinner has asked federal officials to declare all 53 North Dakota counties disaster areas because of the drought.
Sinner says the drought has wiped out small grain crops and is beginning to take a toll on row crops.
The State Agricultural Statistics Service said North Dakota farmers will abandon 31 percent of their spring wheat this year and harvest the smallest crop in 19 years because of the drought.
That compares to a normal abandonment of about 5 percent.
Abandonment has not been so high in the state since the 1930s .
Lt.
Gov. Paul Leonard, who heads a state drought task force, said he would not advocate statewide mandatory water restrictions but said local governments should have the authority to impose restrictions where necessary.
In central Ohio, farmers awaited what will be the largest haylift of the season _ 50 truckloads of hay from the South scheduled to arrive Thursday night in Columbus .
Thunderstorms hit Brown County with heavy rain and hail that damaged drought-stricken crops.
Rain was heavy north and east of Aberdeen and spotty elsewhere.
Stanley and Thelma Dennert, who live three miles west of Houghton, reported 3.75 inches of rain within an hour.
``It was hard with a little bit of hail.
It really came down in sheets,'' said Mrs. Dennert.
Authorities said no tornado sightings were confirmed, but about a dozen funnel clouds were reported .
The drought-plagued Mississippi River measured seventh-tenths of a foot higher than expected at Memphis because of rainfall throughout West Tennessee.
The Mississippi was still 21 feet lower than normal for this time of year, however, and the Coast Guard said the slight rise had no effect on commercial traffic on the river .
The drought has dried up summer jobs at the Stokley USA cannery in Merrill.
During most summers, the plant provides three months' employment for about 300 workers on three shifts, but this year there are only 225 seasonal employees on two shifts, said Vern Warren, plant manager.
``It's been on and off so far.
The drought conditions have made it a little difficult for us,'' Warren said .
WHILE Hurricane Andrew was wreaking havoc across large parts of southern Florida and Louisiana this week, a grade two dollar crisis (on a one-to-four scale, four being most severe) was blowing itself out at the end of a tumultuous few days for US and world financial markets.
On Wall Street, most of the damage from the currency storm was inflicted a week ago Friday and on the following Monday, when bond yields jumped sharply and the Dow Jones industrial average plunged by more than 75 points.
The flimsy walls erected hastily by the Federal Reserve and other big central banks to protect the vulnerable dollar from a tidal wave of selling on foreign exchange markets failed to hold; and as the sellers poured through the breached barricades, the currency dropped to DM1.40.
This was its lowest-ever point against the D-mark.
The conditions necessary for a dollar crisis had been building up in currency markets for some time.
Interest rate differentials between US and Germany widened over the summer as the Fed eased, and the Bundesbank tightened, their respective monetary policies.
The failure of the US economy to climb out of recession with any vigour was also making overseas investors increasingly unhappy about holding the dollar.
So, too, was the political hole President Bush had dug for himself in a re-election battle that only a year ago was supposed to be a shoo-in for the incumbent.
Moreover, the fact that almost every central bank worth its salt was in the markets trying to prop up the dollar served only to convince foreign exchange dealers that the currency was heading in one direction - down.
While there were plenty of reasons for the dealers to sell the dollar, the logic for such a strongly negative reaction from bond and stock markets was less obviously compelling.
There are two standard explanations why a weak dollar prompts bond prices to fall.
The first is that it raises import prices and, as a result, adds to inflationary pressures.
The second is that it makes it hard for the Fed to engineer another cut in interest rates to stimulate the flagging recovery, and raises the possibility that rates may actually have to go up to protect the currency.
The first explanation is not particularly convincing - imports account for not much more than 10 per cent of US gross domestic product, so higher import prices do not greatly effect the overall price level, which is now around 3 per cent and heading lower.
The second explanation carries more weight.
Although there is not much chance, given the present economic and political climate, that the Fed will raise rates to help the dollar, there is little doubt that the currency's weakness makes it extremely difficult for the Fed to ease monetary policy again.
The fear that the Fed may be done with interest rate cuts for the present economic cycle was also behind the selling in equity markets.
But investors in stocks were equally, if not more, troubled by the rise in bond yields.
Just over a week ago, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, which has remained stubbornly high all year despite the poor state of the economy, looked as if it might drop below 7.3 per cent.
The dollar put paid to those hopes and, by the middle of this week, it was approaching 7.45 per cent, putting an upward pressure on the all-important mortgage rate for home-buyers.
The dollar was not the only story in financial markets this week, and the devastating effect of Hurricane Andrew produced a typically hard-eyed, although nonetheless logical, reaction from Wall Street.
The stocks of those insurance companies with the greatest exposure in southern Florida, the area hit worst by the hurricane, all took a tumble.
But the relatively modest losses in Geico, Travelers and Progressive suggested that the market believed the insurers were reserved or reinsured adequately enough to cover hurricane-related claims.
The flip side of the hurricane's coin was a strong showing from the stocks of home construction companies expected to benefit from demand for rebuilding damaged or destroyed homes.
Since there are an estimated 250,000 people left homeless by the storm, there is a lot of work to be done.
The biggest gains among construction stocks this week were posted by Lennar, Oakwood Homes, Engle Homes and Fleetwood, the largest maker of pre-manufactured homes in the US .
A tornado slammed into a shopping district, a residential area and a school Wednesday, killing at least 15 people, injuring more than 300 and trapping people in cars and homes, authorities said.
``It's total destruction where the tornado hit.
Cars are piled on top of each other under piles of rubble where buildings used to be,'' said Danny Cooper, state emergency management director in Montgomery.
Emergency officials in Huntsville reported 15 confirmed deaths, said Henry Jurnigan, a duty officer with the state Emergency Management Agency in Montgomery.
Mayor Steve Hettinger said 305 people were injured and about 500 displaced by the tornado that struck while streets of this northeastern Alabama city filled with rush-hour traffic.
Rescue teams with cranes and floodlights searched the rubble through the night for injured or dead.
``Several people are still trapped in vehicles and apartment complexes and shopping areas,'' said police spokesman Ben Jennings after the twister touched down between 4 and 4:30 p.m. in the city's south section.
``It may be tomorrow before we have a final count,'' Gov. Guy Hunt said at the state's disaster center in Montgomery.
The governor dispatched 50 National Guardsmen, along with search and rescue equipment.
Rescuers picked through piles of rubble 10 to 14 feet deep, and Cooper said police were unable to determine the extent of the damaged area.
Rescuers also were hampered by darkness and plunging temperatures.
``We're even having a few snowflakes,'' said Cooper.
High temperatures in Huntsville were expected to be in the 30s Thursday, he said.
Witnesses said the downtown Jones Valley Elementary School, the Waterford Square and adjacent Queensbury apartment complexes were reduced to rubble by the tornado.
``The only thing left standing was a door frame,'' news photographer Mike Mercier said of the school, which was empty of staff and pupils when the tornado hit.
Police reported one person killed in a car outside the school.
Authorities said at least five were killed at Waterford Square apartments, three at a business school, Southern Junior College, which is located in a converted movie theater, and others in scattered areas.
``Rescuers are digging in the rubble,'' state trooper W.L. Kelly said.
He said two people were killed when the twister hit house trailers in rural areas east of Huntsville.
The fifth death was reported near the shopping district.
The city is home to Marshall Space Flight Center and the Army's Redstone Arsenal, but no serious damage was reported from the space agency or weapons testing center.
``We've called in troopers from around the state to help,'' Kelly said.
Telephone communication and electricity were disrupted by the tornadoes and WAAY-TV, the only station still broadcasting, reported widespread damage.
``It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, and it just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get hold of,'' said real estate broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car when the twister struck.
``It started picking cars up and pushing them around, ...
some of them upside down, some of them just strewn around,'' he said.
Heavy overhead power lines ``started snapping just like a circus performer would snap his whip,'' Carroll said.
``All of these heavy arcing, flashing lines that were just popping and snapping over the top of us ...
it was as if you were looking into an arc-welder, they were so bright,'' he said.
WAAY reported at least one person died when the roof of a business collapsed from winds that overturned cars in the area.
A nearby shopping center also was damaged.
Humana Hospital administrator David Miller said doctors were having difficulty reaching the hospital because of blocked roads.
The National Weather Service earlier said a tornado hit the east Alabama hamlet of Mellow Valley, severely damaging at least one home and causing some injuries.
Weather officials said people were trapped inside a collapsed house.
A spokeswoman for the Clay County Sheriff's Department said people were injured at one house in a rural area 30 miles east of Sylacauga.
Another tornado touched down about 1:30 p.m. as severe weather swept across much of Alabama and the National Weather Service placed most of the state under a tornado watch.
A third tornado was reported shortly before 3:30 p.m. crossing the Coosa River near Titus in east Alabama, the Weather Service said.
In Georgia, five people were injured, four critically, and at least 200 people evacuated after a tornado struck two mobile home parks and an interstate highway near Palmetto, about 25 miles southeast of Atlanta, authorities said.
Authorities in southwestern North Carolina said a pair of storm-spawned tornadoes struck around 10:45 p.m., destroying a vacant house in Henderson County.
The National Weather Service also reported tornadoes inflicting minor property damage in Kentucky and Mississippi .
The 1988 Summer Olympics, kept free of terrorism but tainted by drug scandals, closed Sunday with the pealing of a medieval bell to symbolize the sorrow of parting.
The United States finished third in medals.
The 1,000-year-old, 72-ton Emille Bell, which according to Korean legend has the saddest tone of any in the world, tolled farewell to the more than 9,000 athletes from 160 nations who participated in the 24th Olympiad.
The 16-day event, conducted under extraordinary security, wrapped up with the Soviet Union winning the lion's share of the 237 medals events.
The Soviets took home 132 medals, including 55 gold, the most ever in a Summer Olympics without a major-power boycott.
East Germany had 102 medals and 37 gold, and the United States 94 medals and 36 gold.
Many felt that the United States was robbed of a second-place tie for golds when judges awarded a bout to a South Korean boxer over American Roy Jones in the 156-pound event on the final day of competition.
Because of boycotts in 1980 and 1984, the Games were the first meeting between the Soviet Union and the United States since 1976 in Montreal, and matchups between the two nations provided some of the Games' highlights.
The U.S. men's volleyball team beat the Soviets to defend its 1984 Olympic championship, providing consolation for America's upset in the men's basketball quarterfinals.
America also defeated the Soviets in women's basketball and men's water polo.
At least 1 billion people watched the Olympics via a 115-nation, worldwide TV hookup.
The Seoul Games had the greatest number of athletes (9,633), the most countries, the most gold medals and the most venues (34).
Communist North Korea, which demanded a role in the Games, boycotted them, but the only sports power to follow suit was Cuba.
Among the highlights: _Greg Louganis won the Olympic Spirit Award as top American athlete Sunday for winning gold medals in platform and 3-meter springboard diving.
He accomplished the same feat in 1980 and became the first man to sweep the events twice.
The 28-year-old Louganis, who hit his head on the board in the preliminaries and received five stitches, announced his retirement from diving and said he wanted to pursue acting.
_Sisters-in-law Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner-Kersee led an American assault on the record books in track and field.
Griffith Joyner won golds in the 100, the 200 and the 400-meter relay, and silver in the 1,600-meter relay.
She set a world record in the 200 and an Olympic record in the 100.
Joyner-Kersee won two golds, taking the heptathlon with a world record 7,291 points and the long jump with an Olympic mark of 24 feet, 3 inches.
_Kristin Otto of East Germany won six golds in swimming.
American swimmer Matt Biondi won seven medals, five gold, while Janet Evans earned three golds in the pool for the United States.
_Daniela Silivas of Romania dominated women's gymnastics, winning three golds, two silvers and a bronze.
_West German Steffi Graf completed tennis's first Golden Slam, winning the gold medal as well as all four Grand Slam tournaments _ Wimbledon and the U.S., French and Australian Opens _ in a calendar year.
There were low moments as well.
Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, the most prominent of 10 athletes who tested positive for drugs, was stripped of his gold medal in the 100 meters and title of world's fastest man, and flew home in disgrace, his career in jeopardy.
He was accused of using muscle-building steroids.
Four other medals _ two Bulgarian weightlifting golds, a Hungarian weightlifing silver and a British judo bronze _ also were stripped for drugs, and five non-medalists tested positive for substances ranging from caffeine to diuretics.
Early in the Games, five people connected to the Korean boxing team were suspended for attacking a New Zealand referee after a Korean lost a decision to a Bulgarian.
Another Korean boxer staged a 67-minute sit-in in the ring to protest his loss.
Anthony Hembrick, a U.S. boxer expected to win a gold, never got to fight; his coach misread the schedule and he missed the bus to the arena.
Two gold medal-winning U.S. swimmers were arrested for carrying a stone lion's head out of a hotel bar, but charges were dropped.
American runner Johnny Gray kicked a taxicab in an argument with its driver.
He was arrested and released.
Security measures against the possibility of terrorism were extraordinary, including metal detectors, numerous checkpoints and ID cards, but except for scattered protests by student radicals, the Games proceeded without incident.
At the closing ceremonies, before the great torch was extinguished, Korea passed the Olympic flag to representatives from Barcelona, site of the 1992 Games .
MR TEG BAHADUR Thapar was serving lunch from his stall outside the Bombay stock exchange on Friday when he was showered with flying glass and broken concrete in one of 13 explosions which rocked the city and left at least 255 people killed and over 1,200 injured.
'I'm lucky to be alive,' he said from his hospital bed.
'Who did this?
Who can stop this happening again'?
Across Bombay people were asking themselves the same questions this weekend.
They sensed there was an enormous difference from the riots which scarred the city in December and again in January.
Those were caused by a traditional mix of crime, political agitation and ancient Hindu-Moslem hatreds stirred by the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya.
The weapons used were mostly primitive - knives, clubs and petrol bottles.
Friday's outrage, by contrast, bears the deadly stamp of high-technology terrorism, complete with Semtex plastic explosive, high-grade timers, efficient organisation and money.
The only comparable previous incident was the assassination in 1991 of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister, by Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger terrorists.
But that was a single bomb aimed at one man - the explosions in Bombay were designed to terrorise the nation's commercial capital.
Bombay accounts for 35 per cent of India's exports.
Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, described the blasts as an attack on India's economy.
The immediate assumption both at the highest level and in the streets of Bombay was that those responsible must have been foreigners or had foreign help.
But these suggestions were seen in Bombay as a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from the people who in the popular mind are the real suspects - Moslem extremists who might have taken revenge for the riots which hit India after the Ayodhya mosque's destruction and which left 2,000 dead, including 700 in Bombay.
If Moslems are found to have staged the attacks, the Indian authorities will certainly suspect that the operation was supported from a Moslem country, notably Pakistan.
The implications would be vast.
Breaking diplomatic relations would be the minimum step Delhi could take on a dangerous road.
Mr Rao chose his words carefully during his visit to Bombay: 'There is a definite possibility that our search may not stop within the country.
I do not want to name anybody because it will have ramifications within and outside the country'.
There is no evidence linking the attacks to Moslem extremists, let alone to Pakistan.
Even if Moslem groups are found to be responsible for the bombings, they could have been supplied from other Moslem countries.
India would still face a diplomatic crisis but hardly on the same scale.
For the moment, such concerns seem remote from the streets on Bombay, where the atmosphere yesterday was calm.
Workmen were clearing away rubble at the blast sites, including the blackened stock exchange building.
Bombayites seemed determined to put the outrage behind them.
At the Gymkhana Club and dozens of other sports grounds, hundreds of men and boys were playing cricket as they do every Sunday.
Others were walking along the seafront by the arch of the Gateway of India.
The stock exchange authorities plan to re-start trading as soon as they can -probably today - using an old trading floor the exchange vacated only last year.
Businessmen estimated the main loss to the city would be the loss of life and injuries and the damage caused to blasted buildings.
They did not expect the same widespread disruption to production as occurred during the riots.
Some of the credit for the limited disruption should go the government and the police for promptly calling paramilitary and regular troops to help patrol sensitive districts.
But much more should go to the people of Bombay, who, so far at least, have refused to be goaded into violent protest by the bombers .
Nobody knows why our early ancestors decided to get off their knuckles and stand upright.
Maybe they just wanted a better view of the stars.
And when sky gazers finally realized that the heavenly lights were not the footprints of the gods, but rather millions of blazing stars like our Sun writ far, they began to wonder, How do we get there?
How can we leave this world and travel, not merely the 238,000 miles to the Moon, or 35 million miles to Mars, but through the vast dark silk of interstellar space, across trillions and trillions of miles, to encounter other stars, other solar systems, even other civilizations?
According to a group of scientists for whom the term ''wildly optimistic dreamers'' is virtually a job description, it will indeed be very difficult to travel to other stars, and nobody in either the public or private sector is about to try it any time soon.
But as the researchers see it, the challenge is not insurmountable, it requires no defiance of the laws of physics, so why not have fun and start thinking about it now?
At the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, held last month in Boston, scientists discussed how humans might pull off a real-life version of ''Star Trek,'' minus the space Lycra and perpetual syndication rights.
They talked about propulsion at a reasonable fraction of the speed of light, a velocity that is orders of magnitude greater than any space ship can fly today, but that would be necessary if the light-years of space between the Sun and even the nearest star are ever to be crossed.
They talked about the possibility of multigenerational space travel, and what it might be like for people who board a space ship knowing that they, their children, grandchildren and descendants through 6, 8 or 10 generations would live and die knowing nothing but life in an enclosed and entirely artificial environment, hurtling year upon year through the near-featureless expanse of interstellar space.
They talked about how big the founding crew would have to be to prevent long-term risks of inbreeding and so-called genetic drift.
They talked about how the crew's chain of command would be structured, what language people would most likely speak, and what sort of marital and family policies might be put in place.
And they talked about food, all of which would have to be grown, cultivated and synthesized on board.
''One thing is almost certain,'' said Dr. Jean B. Hunter, an associate professor of biological and environmental engineering at Cornell.
''You'll have to leave the steak, cheesecake and artichokes with hollandaise sauce behind.''
Many of the subjects raised during the session were so fanciful that at times it felt like a discussion of how to clone a unicorn, and indeed half the presenters moonlight as science fiction writers.
Nevertheless, the researchers argued, human beings have shown themselves to be implacable itinerants, capable of colonizing the most hostile environments.
Dr. John H. Moore, a research professor of anthropology at the University of Florida, compared a theoretical crew of spacefaring pioneers to groups of Polynesians setting out tens of thousands of years ago in search of new islands to populate.
''Young people with food and tools would set out in large flotillas of canoes,'' he said.
''Nobody knew if they would ever come back, the trade winds went in only one direction, and many of them perished in the ocean.''
Yet over time, the Polynesians managed to colonize New Zealand, Easter Island and Hawaii.
Still, no human migration in history would compare in difficulty with reaching another star.
The nearest, Alpha Centauri, is about 4.4 light-years from the Sun, and a light-year is equal to almost six trillion miles.
The next nearest star, Sirius, is 8.7 light-years from home.
To give a graphic sense of what these distances mean, Dr. Geoffrey A. Landis of the NASA John Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, pointed out that the fastest objects humans have ever dispatched into space are the Voyager interplanetary probes, which travel at about 9.3 miles per second.
''If a caveman had launched one of those during the last ice age, 11,000 years ago,'' Dr. Landis said, ''it would now be only a fifth of the way toward the nearest star.''
Dr. Robert L. Forward, owner and chief scientist of Forward Unlimited, a consulting company that describes itself as ''specializing in exotic physics and advanced space propulsion,'' argued that rockets and their fuel would be so heavy that they would prevent a starship from reaching the necessary velocity to go anywhere in a sane amount of time.
He envisions a rocketless spacecraft that would be manufactured in space and equipped with an ultrathin, ultralarge sail, its span as big as Texas but using no more material than a small bridge.
A beam of laser light or high-energy particles from a source on Earth, in space or perhaps on the Sun-drenched planet of Mercury would be aimed at the sail, propelling it and its attached module to as much as 30 percent the speed of light -- or about 55,000 miles per second.
At that pace, said Dr. Forward, a crew would reach Alpha Centauri in under 50 years.
''You could get a bunch of 16-year-olds, train them and then send them out at the age of 20,'' he said.
''They'd have a long, boring trip, reach Alpha Centauri when they're in their 60's or 70's, do some exploring, and send everything they learned back home.''
Admittedly, the astronauts would not make it home themselves.
''It's a lifetime job,'' Dr. Forward said.
''But it could be done in a single generation.''
For longer journeys, designed with multigenerational crews in mind, an onboard engine and fuel source would be required, perhaps something powered by nuclear bombs, or the combining of matter and antimatter in a reaction that converts both substances into pure energy.
However the ship is propulsed, the researchers agree that it must be comfortable for long-distance travel.
That means creating artificial gravity by gently rotating the craft; a spin no greater than one or two revolutions per minute would suffice.
It might also mean calling upon architects with Disney-esque sensibilities.
''The inside of one of these long-duration space habitats might feel like the inside of a shopping mall,'' Dr. Landis said.
''Malls are carefully designed to use space efficiently, yet to give you the feeling that they're more spacious than they are.''
And malls, of course, are a great place to bring the family.
In Dr. Moore's view, the good old-fashioned family is the key to success in space.
''Over the past several decades, space scientists and writers of science fiction have speculated at length about the optimum size and composition'' of an interstellar crew, he said.
They have imagined platoons of Chuck Yeager-type stalwarts grimly enduring all hardships, or teams of bionic and vaguely asexual crew members overseeing freezers of embryos that can be defrosted and gestated as needed.
''Some of the scenarios proposed so far are downright alarming from a social science perspective,'' Dr. Moore said, ''since they require bizarre social structures and an intensity of social relationships which are quite beyond the experience of any known human communities.''
In deciding how to organize a star mission, Dr. Moore looks to the most ''familiar, ubiquitous, well-ordered and well-understood'' of social forms, the human family.
''Virtually every human society in history has been structured along kinship lines,'' he said, ''from small-scale foraging societies to empires comprising millions of people.''
Lines of authority and seniority in a family are reasonably clear, and when they're not, well, there's always the time-out chamber.
In Dr. Moore's rendition, all recruits for an interstellar odyssey would be guaranteed the opportunity, though not the requirement, to marry and have children.
Mate choice would be part of the bargain as well, with the population cannily structured so that each cohort of individuals, on reaching sexual maturity, would have about 10 potential partners of a similar age to select from.
Dr. Moore and his colleagues have developed a computer simulation called Ethnopop, in which they asked how large the crew must be in order to maintain genetic variability over time while still allowing crew members a choice of sex partners.
They determined that a founding crew could be as small as 80 to 100 people and stay viable for more than a thousand years, assuming that two rules were followed: women waited until they were in their mid-30's or so before having children, and they had only a couple each.
Counterintuitive though it may seem, said Dr. Moore, delayed childbearing and small families are known to help maintain genetic variability in a closed population.
Genetic diversity may be essential, but Dr. Sarah G. Thomason, a professor of linguistics at the University of Michigan, argued that the same could not be said for language.
''You want everyone to be able to talk to each other as soon as they're on board,'' she said.
As Dr. Thomason sees it, the likeliest lingua franca for a starship will be -- gracias a Dios -- English.
After all, she said, English is the language of the international air traffic control system, the scientific community and the educated class generally.
English is the official language of 51 of the 195 nations of the world, and it is the second language of many others.
Yet, while crew members will be expected to speak English, their accents are likely to be quite diverse, and the English that their children and grandchildren end up speaking will have a rhythm and texture of its own -- Space English.
And though Dr. Thomason believes that the basic structure of Space English is not likely to change much from that of the mother tongue, teenagers will, of course, invent words of their own and drop words of scant use.
''I can imagine the loss of words like snow, rivers, winter, mosquitoes, if they're lucky,'' she said.
Another arena that will test the limits of human ingenuity is space cuisine.
Without livestock on board or supply ships to restock the pantry, crew members will have to be entirely self-sufficient.
Dr. Hunter of Cornell envisions crops grown in hydroponic gardens, in which plants are suspended in troughs like rain gutters, and water and fertilizer are trickled slowly over their roots.
Among the possible food groups are wheat, rice, sweet potatoes, beans, soy, corn, herbs and spices.
In addition, space-minded agronomists are exploring the marvels of microbes.
Plants take weeks to grow, but yeastlike micro-organisms replicating in vats can be used to churn out significant quantities of carbohydrates, sugars, proteins and fats in a matter of hours.
Of benefit to a community in which recycling is not just a personal virtue but a public necessity, micro-organisms can live on the carboniferous waste products of plants and people.
''There's a protein product called quorn, which is made from filamentous mold,'' Dr. Hunter said.
''Not to make a joke of it, but it does taste like chicken.''
Some clichés, it seems, are truly universal.
Correction: March 9, 2002, Saturday An article in Science Times on Tuesday about the challenges of interstellar travel referred imprecisely to the stars nearest Earth's.
While Alpha Centauri is the nearest star system, it has three stars; the nearest is Proxima Centauri, 4.2 light-years away.
The next nearest is Barnard's star, at 6 light-years -- not the double star Sirius, 8.7 light-years away.
In recent years, scientists have made sizable gains in what was once considered an impossible art -- reconstructing the history of Earth's atmosphere back into the dim past.
They can now peer across more than a half billion years.
The scientists have learned about the changing makeup of the vanished gases by teasing subtle clues from fossilized soils, plants and sea creatures.
They have also gained insights from computer models that predict how phenomena like eroding rocks and erupting volcanoes have altered the planet's evolving air.
''It's getting a lot more attention,'' Michael C. MacCracken, chief scientist of the Climate Institute, a research group in Washington, said of the growing field.
For the first time, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations group that analyzes global warming, plans to include a chapter on the reconstructions in its latest report, due early next year.
The discoveries have stirred a little-known dispute that, if resolved, could have major implications.
At issue is whether the findings back or undermine the prevailing view on global warming.
One side foresees a looming crisis of planetary heating; the other, temperature increases that would be more nuisance than catastrophe.
Perhaps surprisingly, both hail from the same camp: scientists who study the big picture of Earth's past, including geologists and paleoclimatologists.
Most public discussions of global warming concentrate on evidence from the last few hundred or, at most, few thousand years.
And some climate scientists remain unconvinced that data from the deep past are solid enough to be relevant to the debates.
But the experts who peer back millions of years, though they may debate what their work means, do agree on the relevance of their findings.
They also agree that the eon known as the Phanerozoic, a lengthy span from the present to 550 million years ago, the dawn of complex life, typically bore concentrations of carbon dioxide that were up to 18 times the levels present in the short reign of Homo sapiens.
The carbon dioxide, the scientists agree, came from volcanoes and other natural sources, as on Mars and Venus.
The levels have generally dropped over the ages, as the carbon became a building block of many rock formations and all living things.
Moreover, the opponents tend to agree on why the early Earth's high carbon dioxide levels failed to roast the planet.
First, the Sun was dimmer in its youth.
Second, as the gas concentrations increase, its heat trapping capacity slows and reaches a plateau.
Where the specialists clash is on what the evidence means for the idea that industrial civilization and the burning of fossil fuels are the main culprits in climate change.
The two sides agree that carbon dioxide can block solar energy that would otherwise radiate back into space, an effect known as greenhouse warming.
But they differ sharply on its strength.
Some argue that CO2 fluctuations over the Phanerozoic follow climate trends fairly well, supporting a causal relationship between high gas levels and high temperatures.
''The geologic record over the past 550 million years indicates a good correlation,'' said Robert A. Berner, a Yale geologist and pioneer of paleoclimate analysis.
''There are other factors at work here.
But in general, global warming is due to CO2.
It was in the past and is now.''
Other experts say that is an oversimplification of a complex picture of natural variation.
The fluctuations in the gas levels, they say, often fall out of step with the planet's hot and cold cycles, undermining the claimed supremacy of carbon dioxide.
''It's too simplistic to say low CO2 was the only cause of the glacial periods'' on time scales of millions of years, said Robert Giegengack, a geologist at the University of Pennsylvania who studies past atmospheres.
''The record violates that one-to-one correspondence.''
He and other doubters say the planet is clearly warming today, as it has repeatedly done, but insist that no one knows exactly why.
Other possible causes, they say, include changes in sea currents, Sun cycles and cosmic rays that bombard the planet.
''More and more data,'' Jan Veizer, an expert on Phanerozoic climates at the University of Ottawa, said, ''point to the Sun and stars as the dominant driver.''
Highlighting the gap, the two sides clash on how much the Earth would warm today if carbon dioxide concentrations double from preindustrial levels, as scientists expect.
Many climatologists see an increase of as much as 8 degrees Fahrenheit.
The skeptics, drawing on Phanerozoic data, tend to see far less, perhaps 2 or 3 degrees.
In the Phanerozoic (the term is Greek for visible life), complex organisms arose.
If its countless ages were compressed into a single year, fish would have appeared in January, land animals in March, dinosaurs in June, monkeys in December and humans late on New Year's Eve.
The Phanerozoic dispute, fought mainly in scholarly journals and scientific meetings, has occurred in isolation from the public debate on global warming.
Al Gore in ''An Inconvenient Truth'' makes no mention of it.
Some mainstream scientists familiar with the Phanerozoic evidence call it too sketchy for public consumption and government policy, if not expert deliberations.
''In my view, the uncertainties are too great to draw any conclusions right now,'' Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton, said.
''It could be that when the dust settles some insight will emerge that will be germane to the current problem -- how do we keep the climate from spinning out of control.''
Skeptics say CO2 crusaders simply find the Phanerozoic data embarrassing and irreconcilable with public alarms.
''People come to me and say, 'Stop talking like this, you're hurting the cause,' '' said Dr. Giegengack of Penn.
Robert A. Rohde, a graduate student in geophysics at the University of California, Berkeley, may represent a neutral voice.
The evidence, he said, ''is that CO2 is just one of many influences.''
For Wikipedia, Mr. Rohde recently drew up graphic overviews of Phanerozoic carbon dioxide, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Phanerozoic-Carbon-Dioxide.png, and climate swings, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Phanerozoic-Climate-Change.png.
For nearly two centuries, scientists have known that the ancient Earth went through ice ages and other climate upheavals.
Their explanations included changes in land forms, ocean flows, solar intensity and Earth's orbit around the Sun.
The new argument dates from 1958, when scientists began to track carbon dioxide in the air, finding its levels low, 0.0315 percent, but increasing.
They knew that excess gas could in theory trap more heat from the Sun, warming the planet and providing a new explanation for climate change.
The greenhouse theory rose to prominence in the 1980's as carbon dioxide continued to increase and as global temperatures started to increase.
While scientists tracked many greenhouse gases, including ozone, methane and water vapor, they focused on carbon dioxide because its concentrations seemed to be rising quite rapidly.
Keen to put the threat in perspective, they sought to compare modern CO2 levels to those of the past.
Ice cores from the frozen regions turned out to harbor tiny air bubbles that showed carbon dioxide concentrations going back hundreds of thousands of years.
Scientists found the preindustrial levels averaging 280 parts per million, down from 315 parts per million, or 0.0315 percent, in 1958.
Scientists suspected that the concentrations were once much higher, especially in hot eras of little or no polar ice.
Eager to push beyond the cores, which went back just a half million years or so, scientists looked for ways to peer further back.
Dr. Berner of Yale focused on computer models.
His studies of the Phanerozoic analyzed factors such as how some ages produced many volcanoes and much atmospheric carbon dioxide and others spawned mountains, extensive weathering of fresh rock and, by that mechanism, considerable uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
From the start, he consistently reported close ties between carbon dioxide and climate swings.
For instance, in the explosion of plant life from 400 million to 300 million years ago, he found a sharp drop in the gas, occurring as the earth entered an ice age.
''These results,'' Dr. Berner wrote in the journal Science in 1990, ''support the notion that the atmospheric CO2 greenhouse mechanism is a major control on climate over very long time scales.''
Other scientists looked for clues among fossilized soils, plants and sea creatures, assuming that fluctuating climates had altered their growth patterns.
In time, the ancient specimens yielded a bonanza of subtle evidence, some confirming aspects of Dr. Berner's modeling.
Claudia I. Mora and two colleagues at the University of Tennessee found that ancient soils verified the steep decline in carbon dioxide between 400 million and 300 million years ago.
Other scientists found conflicting evidence.
In 1992, a team from the University of New Mexico reported that ancient soils showed extremely high levels of carbon dioxide 440 million years ago, an age of primitive sea life before the advent of land plants and animals.
The carbon dioxide levels were roughly 16 times higher than today.
Surprisingly, the scientists said, this appeared to coincide with wide glaciation, an analysis, wrote Crayton J. Yapp and Harald Poths in the journal Nature, that ''suggests that the climate models require modification.''
Throughout the 1990's, reconstruction papers offered evidence on both sides of the debate about the effects of carbon dioxide.
Starting in 2000, the attacks intensified as Dr. Veizer of Ottawa questioned the CO2-climate link across the whole Phanerozoic.
He and two Belgian colleagues, writing in Nature, based their doubts on how two ice ages -- 440 million and 150 million years ago, in the age of dinosaurs -- apparently had very high carbon dioxide levels.
In 2002, Daniel H. Rothman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology also raised sharp Phanerozoic questions after studying carbon dioxide clues teased from marine rocks.
Writing in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, he said that with one exception -- the recent cool period of the last 50 million years -- he could find ''no systematic correspondence'' between carbon dioxide and climate shifts.
In 2003, Dr. Veizer joined Nir J. Shaviv, an astrophysicist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, to propose a new climate driver.
They envisioned slow movements of the solar system through the surrounding galaxy as controlling the cosmic rays that bombard Earth's atmosphere.
A reduction, they argued, would lessen cloud cover and Earth's reflectivity, warming the planet.
The reverse would cause cooling.
The Phanerozoic record of cosmic-ray bombardment showed excellent agreement with climate fluctuations, trumping carbon dioxide, they wrote.
In 2004, Dr. Berner of Yale and four colleagues fired back.
While saying cosmic rays were possibly ''of some climatic significance,'' they argued that such an effect was much less than that of carbon dioxide.
In the debate, opponents can differ not only on the contours of past CO2 fluctuations but also on defining hot and cold eras.
Although Dr. Veizer sees a cold period 150 million years ago, a time of increased ice at sea but not on land because the continents had shifted from the poles, Dr. Berner, in his modeling, disregards it.
Such differences can muddy the dispute.
Today, each side claims new victories.
Dr. Veizer says he has a comprehensive paper on the cosmic-ray theory coming out soon.
Dr. Berner recently refined his model to repair an old inconsistency.
The revision, described in the May issue of The American Journal of Science, brings the model into closer agreement with the fact of wide glaciation 440 million years ago, yielding what he sees as stronger evidence of the dominant role of carbon dioxide then.
Dr. Yapp, once a carbon dioxide skeptic, concurred, saying, ''The data complied in the last decade suggests that long-term climate change correlates pretty well with CO2 changes.''
Some climatologists view the Phanerozoic debate as irrelevant.
They say the evidence of a tie between carbon dioxide and planetary warming over the last few centuries is so compelling that any long-term evidence to the contrary must somehow be tainted.
They also say greenhouse gases are increasing faster than at any other time in Earth history, making the past immaterial.
Carbon dioxide skeptics and others see the reconstructions of the last 15 years as increasingly reliable, posing fundamental questions about the claimed powers of carbon dioxide.
Climatologists and policy makers, they say, need to ponder such complexities rather than trying to ignore or dismiss the unexpected findings.
''Some of the work has been quite meticulous,'' Thure E. Cerling, an expert at the University of Utah on Phanerozoic climates, said.
''We are likely to learn something.''
When Anya Bailey developed an eating disorder after her 12th birthday, her mother took her to a psychiatrist at the University of Minnesota who prescribed a powerful antipsychotic drug called Risperdal.
Created for schizophrenia, Risperdal is not approved to treat eating disorders, but increased appetite is a common side effect and doctors may prescribe drugs as they see fit.
Anya gained weight but within two years developed a crippling knot in her back.
She now receives regular injections of Botox to unclench her back muscles.
She often awakens crying in pain.
Isabella Bailey, Anya's mother, said she had no idea that children might be especially susceptible to Risperdal's side effects.
Nor did she know that Risperdal and similar medicines were not approved at the time to treat children, or that medical trials often cited to justify the use of such drugs had as few as eight children taking the drug by the end.
Just as surprising, Ms. Bailey said, was learning that the university psychiatrist who supervised Anya's care received more than $7,000 from 2003 to 2004 from Johnson &amp; Johnson, Risperdal's maker, in return for lectures about one of the company's drugs.
Doctors, including Anya Bailey's, maintain that payments from drug companies do not influence what they prescribe for patients.
But the intersection of money and medicine, and its effect on the well-being of patients, has become one of the most contentious issues in health care.
Nowhere is that more true than in psychiatry, where increasing payments to doctors have coincided with the growing use in children of a relatively new class of drugs known as atypical antipsychotics.
These best-selling drugs, including Risperdal, Seroquel, Zyprexa, Abilify and Geodon, are now being prescribed to more than half a million children in the United States to help parents deal with behavior problems despite profound risks and almost no approved uses for minors.
A New York Times analysis of records in Minnesota, the only state that requires public reports of all drug company marketing payments to doctors, provides rare documentation of how financial relationships between doctors and drug makers correspond to the growing use of atypicals in children.
From 2000 to 2005, drug maker payments to Minnesota psychiatrists rose more than sixfold, to $1.6 million.
During those same years, prescriptions of antipsychotics for children in Minnesota's Medicaid program rose more than ninefold.
Those who took the most money from makers of atypicals tended to prescribe the drugs to children the most often, the data suggest.
On average, Minnesota psychiatrists who received at least $5,000 from atypical makers from 2000 to 2005 appear to have written three times as many atypical prescriptions for children as psychiatrists who received less or no money.
The Times analysis focused on prescriptions written for about one-third of Minnesota's Medicaid population, almost all of whom are disabled.
Some doctors were misidentified by pharmacists, but the information provides a rough guide to prescribing patterns in the state.
Drug makers underwrite decision makers at every level of care.
They pay doctors who prescribe and recommend drugs, teach about the underlying diseases, perform studies and write guidelines that other doctors often feel bound to follow.
But studies present strong evidence that financial interests can affect decisions, often without people knowing it.
In Minnesota, psychiatrists collected more money from drug makers from 2000 to 2005 than doctors in any other specialty.
Total payments to individual psychiatrists ranged from $51 to more than $689,000, with a median of $1,750.
Since the records are incomplete, these figures probably underestimate doctors' actual incomes.
Such payments could encourage psychiatrists to use drugs in ways that endanger patients' physical health, said Dr. Steven E. Hyman, the provost of Harvard University and former director of the National Institute of Mental Health.
The growing use of atypicals in children is the most troubling example of this, Dr. Hyman said.
''There's an irony that psychiatrists ask patients to have insights into themselves, but we don't connect the wires in our own lives about how money is affecting our profession and putting our patients at risk,'' he said.
The Prescription Anya Bailey is a 15-year-old high school freshman from East Grand Forks, Minn., with pictures of the actor Chad Michael Murray on her bedroom wall.
She has constant discomfort in her neck that leads her to twist it in a birdlike fashion.
Last year, a boy mimicked her in the lunch room.
''The first time, I laughed it off,'' Anya said.
''I said: 'That's so funny.
I think I'll laugh with you.'
Then it got annoying, and I decided to hide it.
I don't want to be made fun of.''
Now she slumps when seated at school to pressure her clenched muscles, she said.
It all began in 2003 when Anya became dangerously thin.
''Nothing tasted good to her,'' Ms. Bailey said.
Psychiatrists at the University of Minnesota, overseen by Dr. George M. Realmuto, settled on Risperdal, not for its calming effects but for its normally unwelcome side effect of increasing appetite and weight gain, Ms. Bailey said.
Anya had other issues that may have recommended Risperdal to doctors, including occasional angry outbursts and having twice heard voices over the previous five years, Ms. Bailey said.
Dr. Realmuto said he did not remember Anya's case, but speaking generally he defended his unapproved use of Risperdal to counter an eating disorder despite the drug's risks.
''When things are dangerous, you use extraordinary measures,'' he said.
Ten years ago, Dr. Realmuto helped conduct a study of Concerta, an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder drug marketed by Johnson &amp; Johnson, which also makes Risperdal.
When Concerta was approved, the company hired him to lecture about it.
He said he gives marketing lectures for several reasons.
''To the extent that a drug is useful, I want to be seen as a leader in my specialty and that I was involved in a scientific study,'' he said.
The money is nice, too, he said.
Dr. Realmuto's university salary is $196,310.
''Academics don't get paid very much,'' he said.
''If I was an entertainer, I think I would certainly do a lot better.''
In 2003, the year Anya came to his clinic, Dr. Realmuto earned $5,000 from Johnson &amp; Johnson for giving three talks about Concerta.
Dr. Realmuto said he could understand someone's worrying that his Concerta lecture fees would influence him to prescribe Concerta but not a different drug from the same company, like Risperdal.
In general, he conceded, his relationship with a drug company might prompt him to try a drug.
Whether he continued to use it, though, would depend entirely on the results.
As the interview continued, Dr. Realmuto said that upon reflection his payments from drug companies had probably opened his door to useless visits from a drug salesman, and he said he would stop giving sponsored lectures in the future.
Kara Russell, a Johnson &amp; Johnson spokeswoman, said that the company selects speakers who have used the drug in patients and have either undertaken research or are aware of the studies.
''Dr.
Realmuto met these criteria,'' Ms. Russell said.
When asked whether these payments may influence doctors' prescribing habits, Ms. Russell said that the talks ''provide an educational opportunity for physicians.''
No one has proved that psychiatrists prescribe atypicals to children because of drug company payments.
Indeed, some who frequently prescribe the drugs to children earn no drug industry money.
And nearly all psychiatrists who accept payments say they remain independent.
Some say they prescribed and extolled the benefits of such drugs before ever receiving payments to speak to other doctors about them.
''If someone takes the point of view that your doctor can be bought, why would you go to an E. R. with your injured child and say, 'Can you help me?'
'' said Dr. Suzanne A. Albrecht, a psychiatrist from Edina, Minn., who earned more than $188,000 from 2002 to 2005 giving drug marketing talks.
The Industry Campaign It is illegal for drug makers to pay doctors directly to prescribe specific products.
Federal rules also bar manufacturers from promoting unapproved, or off-label, uses for drugs.
But doctors are free to prescribe as they see fit, and drug companies can sidestep marketing prohibitions by paying doctors to give lectures in which, if asked, they may discuss unapproved uses.
The drug industry and many doctors say that these promotional lectures provide the field with invaluable education.
Critics say the payments and lectures, often at expensive restaurants, are disguised kickbacks that encourage potentially dangerous drug uses.
The issue is particularly important in psychiatry, because mental problems are not well understood, treatment often involves trial and error, and off-label prescribing is common.
The analysis of Minnesota records shows that from 1997 through 2005, more than a third of Minnesota's licensed psychiatrists took money from drug makers, including the last eight presidents of the Minnesota Psychiatric Society.
The psychiatrist receiving the most from drug companies was Dr. Annette M. Smick, who lives outside Rochester, Minn., and was paid more than $689,000 by drug makers from 1998 to 2004.
At one point Dr. Smick was doing so many sponsored talks that ''it was hard for me to find time to see patients in my clinical practice,'' she said.
''I was providing an educational benefit, and I like teaching,'' Dr. Smick said.
Dr. Steven S. Sharfstein, immediate past president of the American Psychiatric Association, said psychiatrists have become too cozy with drug makers.
One example of this, he said, involves Lexapro, made by Forest Laboratories, which is now the most widely used antidepressant in the country even though there are cheaper alternatives, including generic versions of Prozac.
''Prozac is just as good if not better, and yet we are migrating to the expensive drug instead of the generics,'' Dr. Sharfstein said.
''I think it's the marketing.''
Atypicals have become popular because they can settle almost any extreme behavior, often in minutes, and doctors have few other answers for desperate families.
Their growing use in children is closely tied to the increasingly common and controversial diagnosis of pediatric bipolar disorder, a mood problem marked by aggravation, euphoria, depression and, in some cases, violent outbursts.
The drugs, sometimes called major tranquilizers, act by numbing brain cells to surges of dopamine, a chemical that has been linked to euphoria and psychotic delusions.
Suzette Scheele of Burnsville, Minn., said her 17-year-old son, Matt, was given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder four years ago because of intense mood swings, and now takes Seroquel and Abilify, which have caused substantial weight gain.
''But I don't have to worry about his rages; he's appropriate; he's pleasant to be around,'' Ms. Scheele said.
The sudden popularity of pediatric bipolar diagnosis has coincided with a shift from antidepressants like Prozac to far more expensive atypicals.
In 2000, Minnesota spent more than $521,000 buying antipsychotic drugs, most of it on atypicals, for children on Medicaid.
In 2005, the cost was more than $7.1 million, a 14-fold increase.
The drugs, which can cost $1,000 to $8,000 for a year's supply, are huge sellers worldwide.
In 2006, Zyprexa, made by Eli Lilly, had $4.36 billion in sales, Risperdal $4.18 billion and Seroquel, made by AstraZeneca, $3.42 billion.
Many Minnesota doctors, including the president of the Minnesota Psychiatric Society, said drug makers and their intermediaries are now paying them almost exclusively to talk about bipolar disorder.
The Diagnoses Yet childhood bipolar disorder is an increasingly controversial diagnosis.
Even doctors who believe it is common disagree about its telltale symptoms.
Others suspect it is a fad.
And the scientific evidence that atypicals improve these children's lives is scarce.
One of the first and perhaps most influential studies was financed by AstraZeneca and performed by Dr. Melissa DelBello, a child and adult psychiatrist at the University of Cincinnati.
Dr. DelBello led a research team that tracked for six weeks the moods of 30 adolescents who had received diagnoses of bipolar disorder.
Half of the teenagers took Depakote, an antiseizure drug used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder in adults.
The other half took Seroquel and Depakote.
The two groups did about equally well until the last few days of the study, when those in the Seroquel group scored lower on a standard measure of mania.
By then, almost half of the teenagers getting Seroquel had dropped out because they missed appointments or the drugs did not work.
Just eight of them completed the trial.
In an interview, Dr. DelBello acknowledged that the study was not conclusive.
In the 2002 published paper, however, she and her co-authors reported that Seroquel in combination with Depakote ''is more effective for the treatment of adolescent bipolar mania'' than Depakote alone.
In 2005, a committee of prominent experts from across the country examined all of the studies of treatment for pediatric bipolar disorder and decided that Dr. DelBello's was the only study involving atypicals in bipolar children that deserved its highest rating for scientific rigor.
The panel concluded that doctors should consider atypicals as a first-line treatment for some children.
The guidelines were published in The Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
Three of the four doctors on the panel served as speakers or consultants to makers of atypicals, according to disclosures in the guidelines.
In an interview, Dr. Robert A. Kowatch, a psychiatrist at Cincinnati Children's Hospital and the lead author of the guidelines, said the drug makers' support had no influence on the conclusions.
AstraZeneca hired Dr. DelBello and Dr. Kowatch to give sponsored talks.
They later undertook another study comparing Seroquel and Depakote in bipolar children and found no difference.
Dr. DelBello, who earns $183,500 annually from the University of Cincinnati, would not discuss how much she is paid by AstraZeneca.
''Trust me, I don't make much,'' she said.
Drug company payments did not affect her study or her talks, she said.
In a recent disclosure, Dr. DelBello said that she received marketing or consulting income from eight drug companies, including all five makers of atypicals.
Dr. Realmuto has heard Dr. DelBello speak several times, and her talks persuaded him to use combinations of Depakote and atypicals in bipolar children, he said.
''She's the leader in terms of doing studies on bipolar,'' Dr. Realmuto said.
Some psychiatrists who advocate use of atypicals in children acknowledge that the evidence supporting this use is thin.
But they say children should not go untreated simply because scientists have failed to confirm what clinicians already know.
''We don't have time to wait for them to prove us right,'' said Dr. Kent G. Brockmann, a psychiatrist from the Twin Cities who made more than $16,000 from 2003 to 2005 doing drug talks and one-on-one sales meetings, and last year was a leading prescriber of atypicals to Medicaid children.
The Reaction For Anya Bailey, treatment with an atypical helped her regain her appetite and put on weight, but also heavily sedated her, her mother said.
She developed the disabling knot in her back, the result of a nerve condition called dystonia, in 2005.
The reaction was rare but not unknown.
Atypicals have side effects that are not easy to predict in any one patient.
These include rapid weight gain and blood sugar problems, both risk factors for diabetes; disfiguring tics, dystonia and in rare cases heart attacks and sudden death in the elderly.
In 2006, the Food and Drug Administration received reports of at least 29 children dying and at least 165 more suffering serious side effects in which an antipsychotic was listed as the ''primary suspect.''
That was a substantial jump from 2000, when there were at least 10 deaths and 85 serious side effects among children linked to the drugs.
Since reporting of bad drug effects is mostly voluntary, these numbers likely represent a fraction of the toll.
Jim Minnick, a spokesman for AstraZeneca, said that the company carefully monitors reported problems with Seroquel.
''AstraZeneca believes that Seroquel is safe,'' Mr. Minnick said.
Other psychiatrists renewed Anya's prescriptions for Risperdal until Ms. Bailey took Anya last year to the Mayo Clinic, where a doctor insisted that Ms. Bailey stop the drug.
Unlike most universities and hospitals, the Mayo Clinic restricts doctors from giving drug marketing lectures.
Ms. Bailey said she wished she had waited to see whether counseling would help Anya before trying drugs.
Anya's weight is now normal without the help of drugs, and her counseling ended in March.
An experimental drug, her mother said, has recently helped the pain in her back.
Securities regulators charged one of the richest men in Mexico , Ricardo B. Salinas Pliego , with fraud yesterday , in a lawsuit that seeks to have him barred as a director or officer of any company whose shares trade on an American exchange .
The Securities and Exchange Commission also sought to have Mr. Salinas Pliego , the chairman of TV Azteca , the second-biggest Spanish-language broadcaster , give up more than $ 110 million he made from trading in the company 's stock and debt .
In the lawsuit , the commission contended that Mr. Salinas Pliego reaped '' a tremendous personal profit at the expense of investors '' in the United States and Mexico , then '' coordinated a scheme to conceal '' his involvement from them , TV Azteca 's directors and regulators .
The suit charged that Mr. Salinas Pliego added to his gains by selling more than $ 9 million of stock in TV Azteca while he and other executives rejected advice from their lawyers to disclose his involvement .
The transactions came to light in late 2003 after a New York lawyer , citing the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate governance law , blew the whistle to TV Azteca 's board and threatened to tell the S.E.C. .
After the lawyer 's withdrawal was reported in The New York Times , two American directors commissioned an investigation into the transactions in early 2004 , and then resigned in the spring .
It was later disclosed in a draft of the report of the investigation that Mr. Salinas Pliego had sought to have various law firms endorse his transactions and that the law firms refused .
Mr. Salinas Pliego said in a statement late Tuesday that the S.E.C. 's charges were '' false , in bad faith and discriminatory , '' and that he would fight them .
The case breaks new ground in that it is the first major instance in which a lawyer has followed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and blown the whistle on a client .
It is also unusual in that it seeks to prevent Mr. Salinas Pliego , who owns a controlling stake in the company , from acting as an officer or director of TV Azteca or any other public company .
If the S.E.C. is victorious , it would have try to find ways to restrict Mr. Salinas Pliego from exercising control by voting his shares , perhaps by putting his stock in a trust , people close to the agency say .
The action also highlights a trend of the S.E.C. 's trying to enforce United States securities laws against foreign companies whose stocks and bonds are listed on American markets . ''
Geographic boundaries will not serve to protect those who seek to defraud investors , '' said Spencer C. Barasch , associate district administrator at the S.E.C. '' When companies , domestic or foreign , avail themselves of our capital markets , they have the same responsibility to adhere to U.S. securities law . ''
TV Azteca , whose depository shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange , is a unit of Azteca Holdings , which is controlled by Mr. Salinas Pliego .
TV Azteca is one of the fastest-growing Spanish-language networks in the United States , reaching some 77 percent of Latino homes .
The S.E.C. also filed suit against Pedro Padilla Longoria , the former chief executive of TV Azteca , and Luis J. Echarte Fernández , president and chief of Azteca America and chief financial officer of Grupo Salinas .
Both men are directors of TV Azteca .
Mr. Echarte Fernández paid a civil penalty of $ 200,000 to settle with the agency .
He neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing .
According to the lawsuit , Mr. Salinas Pliego failed to inform shareholders about a complex deal between Unefon , TV Azteca 's phone unit , and a company formed by Mr. Salinas Pliego and an associate , Moises Saba .
That company , called Codisco , bought Unefon debt at a deep discount .
Four months later , Mr. Salinas Pliego reaped more than $ 109 million in suspected ill-gotten profits by selling the Unefon debt back , at full price , to TV Azteca .
According to the S.E.C. , Mr. Salinas Pliego not only failed to disclose the transaction to his board , as the law requires for any related-party transaction , but he also misrepresented the nature of the transaction to his board , the press and the S.E.C. '' After the resignation of TV Azteca 's U.S. legal counsel and a Dec. 24 , 2003 , New York Times article concerning the matter , Mr. Echarte sent an e-mail to Mr. Salinas Pliego and Mr. Padilla stating , ` The damage is done and the situation that we did n't want to explain openly is now in the hands of the press , '' ' according to the S.E.C. press release .
Stephen M. Cutler , director of enforcement at the S.E.C. , said : '' Salinas took from the company a valuable corporate opportunity and over a period of many months concealed that transaction in violation of the U.S. securities laws .
The federal securities laws are designed to ensure full and fair disclosure about related party transactions . ''
Mexico 's main securities regulator , the Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores , has been conducting its own investigation of the Codisco-Unefon affair and has now determined that Mexican securities laws were broken , a top official said Tuesday .
The Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that federal law prohibits the open-ended detention of Cubans who entered the United States during the Mariel boatlift in 1980 and who , despite crimes later committed in the United States , can not be deported because the Cuban government refuses to take them back .
Voting 7 to 2 , the court applied to the deportable group of Mariel Cubans the same rights it found in federal law in a decision four years ago that barred the indefinite detention of a stateless immigrant , lawfully admitted to the United States , whose criminal record made him deportable but who had no place to go .
The Bush administration had argued that the decision in the earlier case did not apply to the Mariel group because , unlike the immigrant , Kestutis Zadvydas , admitted as a refugee from post-World War II Europe , the Cubans had never been granted formal admission to the United States .
Instead , they received a humanitarian parole , which the administration said did not entitle them to the same protection when they violated the country 's hospitality by committing crimes .
But writing for the majority on Wednesday , Justice Antonin Scalia said that because the immigration statute itself made no such distinction , the court could not create one .
In Zadvydas v. Davis , the court held that because detention longer than six months could raise serious constitutional problems , the statute should be interpreted to avoid those problems by limiting detention of a deportable alien who did not pose a risk to the community .
Justice Scalia said the fact that immigrants who had never been formally admitted into the country might have a more tenuous constitutional claim did not change the analysis .
Addressing the government 's argument , Justice Scalia said : '' If we were , as the government seems to believe , free to ` interpret ' statutes as becoming inoperative when they ` approach constitutional limits , ' we would be able to spare ourselves the necessity of ever finding a statute unconstitutional as applied . ''
The decision , Clark v. Martinez .
No. 03-878 , applied to two cases of Cubans found deportable .
One , Sergio Suarez Martinez , convicted of burglary , theft and assault , was taken into custody by immigration officials and ordered removed from the country in January 2001 .
Eighteen months later , he filed a habeas corpus petition based on the Zadvydas decision , which was granted by a federal district court in Oregon in a decision that the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , in San Francisco , affirmed .
Another federal appeals court , in Atlanta , reached the opposite conclusion in denying release to Daniel Benitez , who had filed a habeas corpus petition six months after he was detained and ordered deported for convictions for assault and gun possession .
Some 125,000 Cubans entered the country during the Mariel incident .
The ruling on Wednesday will apply to as many as 1,000 who have been convicted of crimes and are being held without a realistic prospect of repatriation .
The administration had also argued that a decision in the Cubans ' favor would raise national security concerns by making it more difficult to control the country 's borders . ''
If that is so , Congress can attend to it , '' Justice Scalia said in his opinion .
The two dissenters were Justice Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist , who said that the majority had mischaracterized the Zadvydas decision as applying to the Mariel group .
Justice Thomas , in a part of his dissenting opinion that the chief justice did not join , said the Zadvydas decision should be overruled .
The case had drawn considerable attention from international and human rights groups .
Deborah Pearlstein of the group Human Rights First , which had filed a brief , praised the court for rejecting '' one of the farther reaching assertions of administrative power by the executive branch . ''
In another immigration decision on Wednesday , the court accepted the administration 's argument that the absence of a functioning central government in Somalia did not prevent the deportation of Somalis to their home country .
A Somali man , Kayse G. Jama , who entered the United States as a 17-year-old refugee in 1996 and was later convicted of assault , argued that federal law required the consent of the receiving country before deportation .
He lost his case in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit , in St. Louis , while the Ninth Circuit in a separate case had issued an injunction barring further deportations to Somalia .
The Supreme Court affirmed the Eighth Circuit 's ruling by a 5-to-4 vote .
Justice Scalia wrote the majority opinion in Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , No. 03-674 .
Justice David H. Souter wrote a dissenting opinion , joined by Justices John Paul Stevens , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer .
The dispute on the court was over statutory interpretation .
Some sections of the law include such a provision , and the majority said that the court should not find a '' structural inference '' that the requirement also applied to Mr. Jama 's category .
Shares of Taser International , the manufacturer of stun guns whose safety has been questioned , rose more than 22 percent yesterday after the company said a newly published scientific study affirmed that the gun 's electric shocks do not cause cardiac arrest and '' may be safely applied multiple times if needed . ''
The news release issued by Taser quoted directly from the study but did not list the four authors , two of whom are Taser executives .
The release also said that the study was published in a prestigious peer-reviewed journal , Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology .
But the study is scheduled to appear instead in a supplement to the journal , not the journal itself .
Studies in both the journal and the supplement are peer reviewed , according to Dawn Peters , a spokeswoman for the journal 's publisher , Blackwell Publishing .
In a peer-reviewed journal , qualified outside researchers evaluate the findings .
After the news release appeared , Taser 's stock rose sharply , closing at $ 20.80 a share , up $ 3.79 .
Just two days earlier , the stock plunged $ 5.95 , or nearly 30 percent , to $ 14.10 , after the company said that sales might slow because of increased competition .
The news release and the stock market response are the latest episodes in a running debate over the safety of Taser 's pistol-like stun guns , which are sold mainly to police departments but also to the military and to a few civilians .
Most of Taser 's nearly $ 70 million in annual revenue comes from sales to police departments , according to the company .
The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the company 's assertions about the safety of the guns .
Separately , The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the Pentagon had found the guns generally safe , although a military study recommended further studies .
And a California assemblyman , Mark Leno , a Democrat from San Francisco , announced yesterday that he would introduce a bill requiring the collection of data on the use of Taser guns in the state .
While the company 's news release made no mention of the study 's four authors , Taser posted the full four-page study on its Web site .
The study noted that two of the four authors were Robert A. Stratbucker and Max Nerheim , who were identified as Taser employees .
Mr. Stratbucker is the medical director and Mr. Nerheim is the vice president for engineering , the company said .
Asked whether the company had played any role in the conduct of the study , a Taser spokesman , Steve Tuttle , replied in an e-mail message : '' Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology ( PACE ) is the foremost peer-reviewed journal in the field of pacing and implantable cardioversion defibrillation .
The published results of the cardiac safety study of Taser technology speaks for itself . ''
Wayne C. McDaniel of the University of Missouri in Columbia , Mo. , the lead author on the study , said that Mr. Stratbucker and Mr. Nerheim had '' both made important contributions '' to the study .
The fourth author is James E. Brewer , a consultant in Minneapolis .
Neither the January issue of the journal nor the supplement have been distributed yet .
The supplement will publish papers that were presented at a conference in Nice , France , last June , including the study cited by Taser in its news release yesterday , Ms. Peters said .
The study used '' adult domestic pigs chosen to simulate a range of adult human body weights , '' the authors wrote , adding that their work confirmed the cardiac safety of an experimental device that emulated the performance of commercially used devices like the stun guns .
In a major shift within the much-criticized $ 18.4 billion program to rebuild Iraq 's physical infrastructure , the office that the Pentagon formed to oversee the effort will begin handing its responsibilities over to the United States Army Corps of Engineers over the next several months .
Charles Hess , the director of the agency , the Project and Contracting Office , said in a telephone interview from Baghdad that the change was a natural evolution .
He denied that the move was a response to Iraqi and American criticism that the reconstruction effort had focused too much on large projects , started up too slowly and failed to anticipate attacks by insurgents .
As the United States tries to lay the groundwork for a functioning Iraqi government before elections on Jan. 30 , some criticisms of the reconstruction program have carried a particular sting : a major goal of the reconstruction , from power plants and sewage-treatment plants to roads and fire stations , was to persuade ordinary Iraqis of the good will and competence of the post-Saddam Hussein authorities .
While the Army corps has increased electricity output and both agencies have put in place other , smaller-scale projects , most major efforts have faced major delays .
Insurgent attacks have hit both the projects and the workers , prompting some large companies to pull out of Iraq , sending security costs skyrocketing and forcing the elimination or scaling down of dozens of projects .
Mr. Hess defended the reconstruction program as successful , given the hard realities of Iraq , and said the gradual shift of responsibility to the Army corps , with its history of managing construction project in conflict zones , had long been envisioned .
But Rick Barton , co-director of the post-conflict reconstruction program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said the shift '' is a further confirmation that the place is n't safe . '' ''
I assume that the Army corps feels better about going places that are just plain dangerous , '' he said .
The corps has largely avoided the criticism that has dogged the project office .
The corps has had a much lower profile and has enjoyed some construction successes in Iraq .
Its electrical projects have added more than 1,800 megawatts to the Iraqi grid , roughly the equivalent of two large power plants .
But major corps projects , like huge waterway projects in the United States , have also been criticized as grandiose and unresponsive to local needs .
And it was the Army corps that awarded Halliburton an early no-bid contract worth billions of dollars for work on Iraq 's oil fields , which opened the company to lashing criticism .
Whether the corps will fare better than the project office is open to question , Mr. Barton said .
Success in Iraq means engaging the local populace , he said , and '' that has n't been their strength even domestically . ''
Brig. Gen. Thomas Bostick , commander of the Army corps in the Persian Gulf region , said that because the two organizations had been working hand-in-glove from the start , he did not regard the switch as a substantial change .
Rather , he said , the project office , with its emphasis on planning , will slim down as more contracts moved into construction . ''
I see this as a natural progression , '' General Bostick said . ''
To say it 's going to change , and is going to change as a result of negative perception , is not correct . ''
The contracting office and the projects it finances employ about 155 government workers in Baghdad and the United States , about 250 contractors in Iraq and just over 100,000 Iraqis who work on the construction itself .
The contracting office said that 1,550 projects were currently under way , and that $ 2.4 billion had been spent , out of $ 13.95 billion committed specifically to reconstruction .
( Some of the original $ 18.4 billion allocated by Congress has gone to the training of Iraqi security forces and other projects unrelated to construction . )
The planned changes have not been disclosed publicly , but they have been discussed in staff meetings since at least September .
Two former officials at the project office said that uncertainty over exactly who would be in charge of various projects had caused morale problems among some members of a staff that is already coping with work in an extremely dangerous place far from home .
But one of the former officials said that by preventing the project office from becoming a permanent government institution , there was also a positive slant to the shift . ''
This bureaucracy had n't settled in , '' the former official said . ''
Everything was n't static .
In some ways that was a benefit . ''
Even with the changes , it is unlikely that the project office will vanish entirely over the next year , because some projects are still in the planning stages and because moving the dozens of government employees into new jobs will be a major task in itself .
Nine current and former sales executives from an assortment of food companies were charged yesterday with participating in a scheme that created a huge accounting fraud at U.S. Foodservice , which has been under investigation in the United States and in the Netherlands for the last two years .
The executives were arraigned in Federal District Court in Manhattan on conspiracy charges and released .
They worked for companies that sold products like sugar , eggs , seafood and cake mix to U.S. Foodservice , which in turn supplied restaurants , corporate dining rooms and other institutions .
All the executives are accused of approving documents that claimed U.S. Foodservice , a unit of Royal Ahold , was owed millions of dollars more in promotional allowances -- a type of rebate offered by manufacturers to stores and distributors -- than was actually the case .
The scheme had the effect of inflating U.S. Foodservice 's profits , prosecutors say .
The letters were issued by a former U.S. Foodservice chief marketing officer , Mark P. Kaiser , according to court documents .
Mr. Kaiser is awaiting trial on conspiracy and fraud charges , along with Michael J. Resnick , the former chief financial officer .
Two other former U.S. Foodservice executives , Timothy J. Lee and William F. Carter , pleaded guilty to similar charges last summer .
All the defendants charged yesterday signed audit letters containing false information at the request of Mr. Kaiser , the documents state . ''
Their motivation was to maintain a very important business relationship , '' the acting United States attorney for Manhattan , David N. Kelley , said .
Most of the executives are expected to plead guilty , he said at a news conference , adding that none of the companies they worked for have been charged with wrongdoing .
The investigation is continuing , '' upstream and downstream , '' he said .
All of the executives have also been named in a civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission , which accuses them of aiding and abetting a financial fraud .
Promotional allowances are intended to be used to help sell a manufacturer 's goods to consumers , through discounts , displays or advertising , and they often add up to large amounts of money .
U.S. Foodservice would pay the price of goods up front , as part of its costs , then book promotional allowances as assets in its records , according to court documents .
Exaggerating the promotional allowances , sometimes by a factor of 30 or more , not only made U.S. Foodservice look like a better business than it was , but also improved the financial appearance of its parent , Royal Ahold .
Royal Ahold , a publicly traded company based in the Netherlands , revealed in February 2003 that it had overstated earnings by at least $ 500 million over the previous two years .
The figure was later revised to $ 880 million .
Royal Ahold said much of the overstatement came from promotional allowances recorded by U.S. Foodservice .
A host of executives , including the top management of Royal Ahold , resigned .
In a case involving John Nettle , a 45-year-old former vice president at General Mills , a letter prepared by U.S. Foodservice 's auditor stated that General Mills owed the company $ 13.44 million at the end of 2001 . ''
In truth and in fact , General Mills owed U.S.F. less than $ 2.5 million , '' the government charged in court documents .
Mr. Nettle is accused of signing the letter despite the false information .
For 2002 , he signed a letter stating that General Mills owed U.S. Foodservice $ 36.64 million , although the amount was actually less than $ 1 million , according to the documents . ''
As Nettle well knew , the $ 36.64 million figure was grossly overstated and General Mills did not owe that amount , '' the documents state .
A lawyer for Mr. Nettle , William Michael , said his client '' was pressured into signing these letters and he is very sorry for what this has caused his former employer as well as his family . ''
He said that Mr. Nettle planned to plead guilty .
Two of the defendants have been charged with securities fraud and obstruction of a federal investigation .
Mark Bailin , who was president of Rymer International Seafood , and Peter Marion , president of Maritime Seafood Processors , are accused of buying U.S. Foodservice stock in 2000 , ahead of the company 's announcement that it was being acquired by Royal Ahold .
They made about $ 1.5 million in illegal profits , according to court documents .
Insurgents on Tuesday released a Syrian Catholic archbishop they had snatched from the streets of Mosul the day before , but a few hours later a new hostage drama opened when eight Chinese construction workers were shown forlornly staring at a video camera with masked men pointing guns at their heads .
Also , the Iraqi interior minister issued a bleak forecast , saying that unless enough people vote in the elections on Jan. 30 , the country would tear itself apart . ''
If there are not good elections , we wo n't have a constitution , and there will be chaos , and we will have a civil war , '' the minister , Falah Hassan al-Naqib , said at a news conference in the heavily fortified Interior Ministry in Baghdad .
Gunfire rattled behind him nearly the whole time he spoke .
Mr. Naqib did not specify how much voter turnout would qualify as a good election .
John D. Negroponte , the American ambassador to Iraq , said he was confident that '' elections can and will be conducted successfully , '' but he acknowledged that there was no end in sight to the insurgency and that American officials still did not know how big it was .
Among American and Iraqi officials , estimates of the number of insurgents have fluctuated wildly , from the thousands , as the Pentagon has said , to the hundreds of thousands , as many Iraqi officials say .
Right now , there are around 425 attacks a week in Iraq , according to American officials , nearly the same rate as six months ago .
The newly released archbishop , Basile Georges Casmoussa , was in a jovial mood as he met with well-wishers at his Eastern Rite Catholic church in Mosul , a crime-ridden city in northern Iraq that contains one of Iraq 's larger Christian communities .
Christians make up about 3 percent of Iraq 's total population .
Recounting his abduction , the archbishop said he was coming home from work on Monday evening , just around dusk , when a car suddenly blocked the road in front of him and gunmen jumped out .
Insurgents grabbed the 66-year-old archbishop and stuffed him in the trunk . ''
I thought these were the last minutes of my life , '' he said .
He said the insurgents kept asking the same question : Are you an American spy ? ''
I told them , you do not know me , '' he said . ''
We are Christians , and we believe the Americans are occupiers . ''
The archbishop was released Tuesday morning .
The eight Chinese workers are still missing , and the only clue to their whereabouts is a hazy video shot in front of a brick wall and broadcast Tuesday on several Arab television channels .
The insurgents said in a statement that the Chinese men were working for the American military and demanded that the Chinese government , which has stayed relatively quiet on the issue of Iraq , declare its opinion of the occupation .
Mr. Naqib , the interior minister , talking about insurgent attacks , said that from the beginning there has been a conspiracy to undermine the rebuilding of Iraq , and that it may only get worse . ''
Certain religious and political groups -- Iraqis , but helped by others -- are trying to fragment this country , '' he said . ''
It 's treason if you do n't vote because it will arouse a civil war . ''
American and Iraqi officials are desperately trying to draw Sunni Arabs , who are a fifth of the population but who are thought to make up the bulk of the resistance , into the electoral process .
Many Sunni political parties are boycotting the vote , calling it illegitimate .
But according to an Iraqi cable television station , at least one group of Sunni tribes in Tikrit announced Tuesday that it would take part in the elections .
Officials from the International Organization for Migration announced Tuesday that more than 18,000 Iraqi expatriates in 14 countries registered Monday to vote in Iraq 's election .
In the United States , 3,270 Iraqis registered .
Monday was the first day to register , and the process will run through Sunday .
In Baghdad on Tuesday , an American soldier was killed by a bomb blast , and at least one member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , a leading Shiite political party , was killed by a suicide bombing.The familiar residue of charred car parts and spilled motor oil littered the streets in front of the party 's headquarters . ''
The car tried to burst into the building but the brave guards faced it , '' said Reza Jawad Taki , a party officer .
[ In a suicide car-bombing early Wednesday , Reuters reported , two people were killed near the Australian Embassy in Baghdad .
A few minutes later , a second suicide car-bombing killed six people near a police building in the north-central area of the city , Agence France-Presse reported . ]
Elsewhere , an American soldier was killed in western Iraq , the military said Tuesday .
Also on Tuesday , news agencies reported that gunmen recently killed three political candidates in different parts of the country , and the government announced that it was closing the borders during the election , except for Muslim pilgrims returning from Saudi Arabia .
-------------------- 3 Britons on Trial in Abuse Case ( By The New York Times ) , LONDON , Jan. 16 -- The British Army opened court-martial proceedings against three soldiers accused of abusing Iraqi prisoners who were thought to have stolen from a British base near Basra in May 2003 .
The court , at a British military base in Osnabrück , Germany , was shown photographs taken by five British soldiers of Iraqis , often naked , forced to simulate sexual acts and being beaten or mistreated .
British news reports likened the incidents to abuse by American soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad .
One of the soldiers on trial , Lance Cpl. Darren Larkin , admitted assaulting an unidentified man at the base .
The two other soldiers , Cpl. Daniel Kenyon and Lance Cpl. Mark Cooley , denied all the charges .
While some Democrats are still struggling to find their voices after November 's election losses , Senator Barbara Boxer of California is not among them .
Her full-throated and combative questioning of Condoleezza Rice during two days of hearings on her nomination to be secretary of state was a vivid illustration of the aggressive posture that Ms. Boxer , a 64-year-old liberal from Marin County , near San Francisco , brought back to Washington after rolling up a big margin of victory in her re-election to a third term .
Before casting one of two Democratic votes against Ms. Rice on the Foreign Relations Committee -- the other was John Kerry 's -- Ms. Boxer explained bluntly why she had been so persistent in pressing the national security adviser on what Ms. Boxer portrayed as the administration 's misleading and misguided rationale for the war in Iraq . ''
The fact is we 've lost so many lives over it , '' she said . ''
So if we do get a little testy on the point , and I admit to be so , it 's because it continues day in and day out , and 25 percent of the dead are from California .
We can not forget .
We can not forget that . ''
Her jousting with Ms. Rice made her the most outspoken foe in the hearings .
And it came after Ms. Boxer earlier this month joined a handful of House Democrats in forcing a debate on the legitimacy of the presidential electoral votes from Ohio ; she was the only senator to vote to challenge Ohio 's votes .
It is clear that she is interpreting her easy win in November , when she accumulated the third-largest number of votes in the nation , behind only the presidential contenders , as a mandate of her own . ''
The people of California knew exactly what I stood for and said to me , ` Barbara , go and be a truth teller , '' ' she said in an interview after the hearings .
The exchanges between the two accomplished women -- '' she 's a very good debater and I 'm a pretty good debater , and that 's interesting , '' the senator said -- marked some of the most compelling moments during hearings that had a certain outcome , since Ms. Rice 's confirmation was never in doubt .
Even so , the publicity that their sharp exchanges attracted may have helped persuade the Democrats to demand on Wednesday a debate on the nomination on the Senate floor as well , which would delay the confirmation vote until next week .
Republicans privately accused her of grandstanding and playing to the party 's left wing , but conceded that that was her prerogative .
Supporters of Ms. Rice said Ms. Boxer had inflicted no damage on the nominee , who on Tuesday cautioned the senator about '' impugning my integrity . ''
Democratic colleagues said they had no doubt about the Californian 's sincerity . ''
I do n't always agree with her , '' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York , who has known Ms. Boxer since she was elected to the House in 1982 . ''
But she is wholly genuine .
She really believes what she says .
She feels it strongly .
She is not posturing . ''
Ms. Boxer has been source of political frustration for California Republicans , who have been unable to defeat her despite her liberal voting record and her prominent role as a legislative leader on protecting abortion rights .
She rolled up a 20 percentage point win in November over the Republican challenger , Bill Jones , and accumulated just under seven million votes , the highest total ever for a senator . ''
She said on election night that she was not going to be afraid to stand alone , '' said David Sandretti , her chief spokesman .
Jack Pitney , a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College and a former Republican operative in Washington , said : '' She has always portrayed herself as a fighter and this is part of her personality .
This aggressive critic of the powers that be is the role for which she was born . ''
Ms. Boxer 's split with Dianne Feinstein , her fellow Democratic senator from California , on Ms. Rice 's suitability to be secretary of state was stark : Ms. Feinstein introduced the nominee to the committee in laudatory terms . ''
The people of California elected two separate senators , '' Ms. Boxer said . ''
We are not joined at the hip .
We do n't always agree . ''
Had she not been willing to take on Ms. Rice over the buildup to the war , Ms. Boxer said , she would not deserve her seat in the Senate .
All she did , she said , was confront the nominee with her own words and the record . ''
This is nothing personal , '' she said . ''
This is who I am . ''
Insurgents detonated five powerful truck and car bombs across Baghdad on Wednesday , killing 26 people , at least 9 of them members of Iraq 's fledgling security forces .
The attacks came as Iraq 's interim prime minister , Ayad Allawi , said he would reveal plans next week for an accelerated buildup of those forces to prepare for an eventual American withdrawal .
Responding to political pressures within Iraq ahead of the Jan. 30 elections and mounting questions in Washington about the prospects for an American pullout , Dr. Allawi said he had been talking with the United States commanders in Baghdad about ways to accelerate the '' training , equipping and deploying '' of Iraqi security forces .
He added that '' this in turn will accelerate the drawdown and gradual withdrawal of the multinational forces in Iraq . ''
Those forces are made up of about 150,000 troops from the United States and upward of 25,000 from other nations .
But Dr. Allawi raised the tantalizing prospect of an eventual American withdrawal while giving little away , insisting that a pullout could not be tied to a fixed timetable , but rather to the Iraqi forces ' progress toward standing on their own .
That formula is similar to what President Bush and other senior administration officials have spoken about .
Some American military commanders have said privately that with this approach and considering the demoralization , desertion and unwillingness to fight common among Iraqi forces trained so far , American troops could be tied down for years , unless elections or other political developments bring the war to an unexpected end . ''
I will be explaining this carefully planned process -- what I call a ` conditions based ' rather than a ` calendar based ' gradual withdrawal program , in more detail next week , '' Dr. Allawi told reporters at a ceremony at Baghdad airport .
He was there to accept the first of three C-130 military transport planes that Iraq is to receive as part of the American-financed buildup of Iraqi forces .
The aircraft was the first large plane acquired by the new Iraqi Air Force , which was one of the most powerful in the Middle East before it was decimated by bombing attacks in the 1991 Persian Gulf war .
Dr. Allawi 's remarks were made on a day when attacks underlined , once again , how insurgents have turned wide areas of the country , including Baghdad , into what is effectively enemy territory , with an ability to strike almost at will , and to shake off the losses inflicted by American troops .
The attacks in Baghdad on Wednesday were aimed at the approaches to the Australian Embassy and four Iraqi security targets , including a police station , an army garrison and a bank where policemen were lining up to receive their monthly pay .
The attacks , four of them within 90 minutes in the morning rush hour , rattled windows and doors miles away .
Spread across a wide area of the city , they wounded dozens of people , most of them Iraqi civilians , in addition to those killed , and served as a reminder of the insurgents ' power to spread mayhem across the capital only 11 days before the elections .
American commanders have sought to prepare public opinion in Iraq and abroad for one of the bloodiest chapters in the war so far , saying the escalation of violence promised by the insurgents can be diminished to a degree , but not prevented , by an increasing tempo of American military raids on insurgent groups .
The American hope is that the voting , for a national assembly and provincial councils , will help turn the tide by drawing a strong turnout among more than 14 million eligible voters , despite the threat of attacks by Sunni insurgents on polling stations , candidates and voters , and a boycott of the election being urged by powerful figures in regions where Iraq 's Sunni minority population predominates .
In almost any foreseeable outcome of the election , the Sunnis face the prospect , for the first time in centuries , of ceding political power in Baghdad to the country 's 60 percent Shiite majority .
Wednesday 's deadliest attack occurred near a police station and Al Alahi hospital in the Alwiyah district of eastern Baghdad .
The American command said a suicide car bomber killed 18 people , including 5 Iraqi policemen , and that 15 other people had been wounded .
In a car bomb attack on an Iraqi military garrison on the site of Baghdad 's old Muthana inner-city airfield and another attack at a checkpoint on the perimeter of the heavily secured Baghdad International Airport , two Iraqi soldiers and two security guards were killed .
The first attack , shortly after 7 a.m. , involved a truck packed with explosives that approached concrete barriers guarding the Australian Embassy compound in southern Baghdad .
The American command said two Iraqis were killed .
A spokesman for the American command , Lt. Col. James Hutton of the First Cavalry Division , said that none of the bombers Wednesday had reached their intended targets . ''
While any loss of life is tragic , it could have been a lot worse , '' he said .
Nevertheless , at the worst of the bombing sites there were deep craters , pools of blood , scattered human remains and shattered buildings .
Near the Rafidain bank in the Etifiyah neighborhood of north-central Baghdad , where a bomb went off as policemen lined up for their salaries , a crumpled child 's bicycle lay near the center of the blast ; people there said a boy had been killed .
The new United States-trained Iraqi Army , National Guard and police force have had hundreds of men killed in the past year .
Now , American election plans depend on these forces protecting more than 5,500 polling places .
The insurgents ' threats to Iraqis seen as working for or alongside the Americans were demonstrated on Wednesday in a video posted on an Islamic militant Web site of the killing of two Iraqi telecommunications technicians .
The video showed the men , still alive , posed in front of a black banner emblazoned with the name of an Islamic terrorist group , Ansar al Sunna , that has claimed responsibility for many of the most brutal attacks of the war in the past year .
They were then shown crouching before a stone wall , blindfolded , as their executioner approached from off camera and killed them with pistol shots to the back of the head .
Earlier , the men confessed that they had been sent to the northern cities of Mosul and Erbil on an American contract to install computer communications for the elections .
At least 11 other people were killed on Wednesday .
Gunmen who attacked the Baghdad offices of a major Kurdish party , the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan , killed one party member and wouned others , party officials said .
Also in Baghdad , another car bomb aimed at an American convoy missed its target but killed four Iraqi bystanders .
In Hilla , 60 miles south of Baghdad , an Iraqi policeman was killed in a car bombing , according to a Polish military spokesman .
Much of the remaining violence was in northern Iraq , in Erbil , Dohuk , Kirkuk and Mosul .
Just weeks after losing his world-famous winery , Robert Mondavi is going back into the wine business , briefly , with a surprising partner -- his brother Peter .
It will be a small venture .
But it will be the first public collaboration of the two nonagenarians since a legendary dispute some 40 years ago that prompted Robert to split with his family and start his own business .
Together , Robert , 92 , and Peter , 90 , will produce a small barrel of wine -- 60 magnums to be exact -- to be sold next summer at the Napa Valley Auction , the California wine world 's premier social event .
The lighthearted venture , arranged by the brothers ' winemaking sons , is heavy with symbolism , coming as it does so soon after the implosion of the Robert Mondavi Winery and its subsequent sale to Constellation Brands late last year for about $ 1 billion .
It represents a formal healing of a breach that kept the two branches of the renowned wine family apart for almost half a century and it represents , too , a recognition that while the two factions may have stood for different ways of winemaking , they were in the long run , not as far apart as they once had thought .
For the first time since his teenage years , Robert Mondavi has no formal connection to a winery .
For his brother it is a vindication of sorts of his quieter style of running a major winery , in this case , the Charles Krug Winery , just up the road from the Robert Mondavi Winery in the Napa Valley .
The Mondavi brothers ' father , Cesare , a grape shipper in the Central Valley , bought Charles Krug in 1943 for his sons to run .
The sons bickered over how to run the business , culminating in the 1965 altercation .
In an interview yesterday , Peter Mondavi Jr. said the breach between his father and his uncle had been closing slowly in recent years .
He said the one-time joint winemaking venture was meant in part to show family solidarity in the light of his uncle 's recent reverses .
He also said that Krug , which is entirely family owned and run by his father , his brother Mark and himself , is just completing a $ 20 million renovation and expansion , all of it financed internally .
There was never any thought of a public offering to raise cash , he said , a pointed reference to Robert Mondavi 's public issue in the 1990 's and that winery 's subsequent and ultimately unsuccessful struggle to satisfy stockholder expectations .
With over 850 acres of vineyards , the Krug winery -- which has no connections with Krug Champagne in France , is one of the largest land owners in the Napa Valley .
Its business is divided into two parts , one producing inexpensive wines under the CK Mondavi label , the other concentrating on high-end wines .
Peter Mondavi Jr. said he and his cousin , Tim , Robert 's younger son , would make the wine , each contributing half a barrel from their cellars .
Tim Mondavi was his father 's chief winemaker before the sale .
Both branches of the family were represented at a dinner in New York last night given by Wine Enthusiast Magazine to honor Mel Dick , a prominent distributor .
Tim Mondavi , standing with his cousin Peter at the dinner , said of his family 's problems : '' We did n't want it to happen , but it happened .
But our roots are strong in the business and we will grow again . ''
Will the one-barrel venture lead to any longer-term collaboration between the families ? ''
We 're taking it one step at a time , '' Peter Mondavi Jr. said .
But , he added with a grin , '' Stay tuned . ''
Awash in cash and practically debt free , Royal Philips Electronics said Thursday that it would buy back up to 750 million euros ( $ 978 million ) of its own stock this year and search for acquisition targets even as a previous purchase put a dent in its fourth-quarter earnings .
Philips , the Dutch health care and technology concern , said a 16.7 percent decline in its fourth-quarter profit , to 498 million euros , was a result of a significant write-down of its stake in MedQuist , a medical transcription company that is the subject of class-action lawsuits and investigations by securities regulators .
Philips 's fourth-quarter sales rose 2 percent , to 9.18 billion euros , compared with the same period a year earlier .
Both its sales and net profit results exceeded many analysts ' expectations .
Philips had announced the MedQuist write-down of 576 million euros last November , and it was one of only a few negative notes in otherwise upbeat annual results .
For the year , net profits at Philips rose more than 300 percent to 2.84 billion euros ( $ 3.7 billion ) compared with 695 million euros the year before .
Operating profit was 1.6 billion euros compared with 488 million euros in 2003 .
Sales increased 4.5 percent , to 30.3 billion euros .
The results for Philips and its plan to buy back shares drove its share price up 4.45 percent , to 19.50 euros .
Jan Hommen , the chief financial officer , said that Philips believed its stock was undervalued . ''
The value of the share price could be higher , '' Mr. Hommen said in an interview .
The stock buyback '' seems like a good investment in our own company , '' he said , adding , '' It 's a better way to use our cash than letting it sit in a 1 or 2 percent account '' generating interest .
Gerard J. Kleisterlee , the chief executive , said in an interview that Philips would allocate a bigger chunk of its budget to increasing the company 's name and brand recognition in the United States this year .
The company did not release performance figures for its long-suffering consumer electronics business in the United States , but indicated that things were improving .
An official of Philips once threatened to stop selling consumer electronics in the United States altogether if the company could not make a profit . ''
We are n't considering closing it , so you can draw your own conclusions , '' Mr. Kleisterlee said in an interview . ''
We are comfortable with where we are . ''
Philips said it was guardedly optimistic about the coming year , but remained concerned about the fragility of world economies .
'' WHAT stresses me most , '' the chief executive of Novartis , Daniel L. Vasella , said , '' is that we are getting new regulations from abroad without any consultation . ''
This has been the World Economic Forum that the United States government largely passed by .
In a world that both respects and fears American power , there is worry that the United States does not care what others think .
Or , as Tony Blair , the prime minister of Britain , put it in a speech to the forum , '' If America wants the rest of the world to be part of the agenda it has set , it must be part of their agenda , too . ''
He added , '' What people want is not for America to concede , but for America to engage . ''
It is a fair bet that Mr. Blair has given little thought to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or to the way the Securities and Exchange Commission can adjust accounting rules , which is what concerns Mr. Vasella .
Mr. Blair was more concerned with global warming and world poverty .
The twin American deficits figured into concerns that the United States would do as it pleases regardless of the possible impact on the world economy . ''
I do n't see the budget deficit being dealt with , '' said Jacob Frenkel , the former head of Israel 's central bank and now a vice chairman of the American International Group , a large insurance company . ''
I am concerned with the U.S. current-account deficit , not because it can not be dealt with but because of the way it is not being dealt with . ''
The explanation for less American government participation than in past years -- that this forum came at an awkward time just before the State of the Union address -- makes some sense .
And there were Americans here , like John A. Thain , the chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange , who gently suggested that the current-account deficit would decline if Europe grew faster .
Some Americans are listening .
William H. Donaldson , the chairman of the S.E.C. , gave a speech in London this week that dealt with some of the concerns , indicating the commission may delay enforcing rules against foreign companies that trade in the United States and may make it easier for foreign companies already registered in the United States to withdraw .
The rule that has both American and foreign companies complaining is Section 404 , which requires extensive reviews of internal controls in companies to assure they are effective -- and says outside auditors must certify the controls . ''
It was an enormous , expensive exercise , '' Mr. Vasella said in an interview . ''
It raised the question , for my employees , ` Is the trust broken ? '
because you control everything . ''
Novartis has complied with the rule .
The chief executive of PricewaterhouseCoopers , Samuel A. DiPiazza Jr. , estimated that 10 percent of large American companies would fail to comply this year , either because they could not complete the work on time or because material problems were found .
A survey of 1,324 chief executives by his firm found that bosses around the world were less confident they could comply with rules outside their home countries .
Mr. Vasella said chief executives of several smaller European countries told him they might try to leave the American market .
He said he asked them if they would do so because they had something to hide , or because of the expense .
Mr. Donaldson is wise to try to assuage European concerns , but there is a risk that other parts of the American government are less sure of the need to take foreign views into account .
That may prove to be unwise for a country that needs help in many areas , not the least of them being in borrowing money to finance the twin deficits .
After a contest that had pitted domestic pride against global politics , the Pentagon yesterday chose an international team , headed by Lockheed Martin , to build the next fleet of presidential helicopters over Sikorsky Aircraft , which had positioned itself as the '' all-American '' choice .
In selecting Lockheed , which will receive $ 1.7 billion initially to begin the program , the Pentagon signaled a new openness to foreign partners on sensitive military tasks .
By doing so , it also rewarded Britain and Italy , two of the United States ' staunchest allies in the Iraq War .
The helicopter fleet , which will be ready in 2009 , will be built by a joint venture of Lockheed and AgustaWestland , a British-Italian venture that designed much of the helicopter and will make about a third of it .
John Young , the assistant Navy secretary who made the announcement , argued that politics played no role in the selection .
But it was immediately denounced as '' outrageously wrong '' by Senator Joseph Lieberman , a Connecticut Democrat , who lobbied strongly for Sikorsky to continue building the White House 's helicopters , a role that dates back to the Eisenhower era .
Sikorsky , a subsidiary of United Technologies , is based in Connecticut .
New York 's Congressional delegation , by contrast , lined up with the Lockheed group , supporting it because some of the work will be done at a new Lockheed plant in upstate New York .
The $ 6.1 billion contract -- $ 3.6 billion for the fleet of 23 helicopters and the rest for research and development -- is far from the Pentagon 's largest .
But it is full of symbolic value and was seen as a critical test of the Pentagon 's willingness to do business with foreign military companies . ''
We picked based on the best value for the mission , '' Mr. Young said in a Pentagon briefing . ''
There are no political influences on this .
I was not asked by anyone to pick a particular one . ''
To emphasize the point , Mr. Young added , '' No one at the White House contacted me . ''
The selection of a new presidential helicopter fleet -- the helicopters are designated Marine One when the president is on board -- took on new urgency after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , when more communications equipment was added to the existing fleet , making the current models heavier and less maneuverable , especially at low altitudes .
The new helicopters will be able to carry more weight , and fly farther and faster than the ones that currently ferry the president . ''
This announcement is a strong endorsement of a two-way street with Europe , '' said Richard Aboulafia , an analyst with the Teal Group , an aerospace research firm in northern Virginia . ''
It is , however , hard to deny that politics played a role when the winner is two of the United States ' Iraq War allies and you have a case of Connecticut versus Texas . ''
The other lead player in the Lockheed team is Bell Helicopter , which is based in Amarillo , Tex. .
Lobbying for the Lockheed-AgustaWestland team took place at the highest levels .
Both Tony Blair , the British prime minister , and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy raised the issue directly with President Bush in White House visits .
The most recent pitch took place just before Christmas , when Mr. Berlusconi parried with Mr. Bush at a news conference , praising the quality of the Italian-designed aircraft . ''
I can only say that I 've been flying these helicopters for 30 years and I am still here , '' said Mr. Berlusconi .
In response , Mr. Bush said : '' And you 've never crashed .
That 's a good start . ''
In a more serious vein , Mr. Bush said that Mr. Berlusconi had emphasized that most of the work would be done in the United States . ''
I understand the nature of U.S. jobs that will be created in the venture , '' he said , '' and I assured him the venture will be treated fairly . ''
Both sides waged all-out publicity campaigns , with billboards , radio and magazine ads .
They lined up politicians to press their cases , and some of them are taking credit for the Lockheed selection . ''
I was pleased to have actively and aggressively supported Lockheed Martin , '' George E. Pataki , New York 's Republican governor , said yesterday .
Senator Charles E. Schumer , the New York Democrat , said yesterday that he had spoken to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell '' to get them to use their influence to secure Lockheed the contract . ''
And Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , Democrat of New York , who had flown in Marine One as first lady , personally telephoned Mr. Blair before a recent meeting with President Bush to urge him to press for Lockheed .
Senator Clinton was at the plant in Owego , N.Y. , where Lockheed will make part of the craft , yesterday and called the presidential helicopter an '' Oval Office in the sky . ''
Many in Congress opposed to Lockheed 's international team argued that the president should be ferried only in a helicopter that was American designed and made .
To quell those concerns , Lockheed lined up a roster of suppliers around the country and committed itself to making the airframes in Texas .
It also agreed to set up a new plant in upstate New York and spread work to companies in California and New England .
On the Sikorsky side , many members of Congress who had lobbied for it expressed bitter disappointment with the decision . ''
Made in America should mean something , '' said Rosa L. DeLauro , a Democratic representative from Stratford , Conn. , as she stood outside the Sikorsky plant there . ''
The Defense Department has some explaining to do . ''
And Duncan Hunter , a California Republican who is a staunch '' Buy America '' proponent and serves as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , deplored the decision . ''
It is difficult to understand why we would use U.S. tax dollars to fund the further development of foreign helicopter technology , '' he said .
Mr. Young said that two-thirds of the work on the new helicopters would take place in the United States , with the rest split between Italy and Britain .
AgustaWestland is a subsidiary of the Italian firm , Finmeccanica .
Several crucial components of the craft , including the transmission and rotor blades , will be built overseas .
Lockheed itself will serve as a systems-integrator for the craft , and provide all the technical components and computers to connect it to the rest of the world .
The helicopter chosen by the Pentagon , called the US 101 , is a variation of one already in use by the British Royal Navy ; it has been purchased by several other European countries and it is used to ferry the Pope .
What swayed the Pentagon to Lockheed , Mr. Young said , was the fact that the US 101 has a larger cabin , can carry a heavier payload and could be put into service faster than Sikorsky 's offering , the VH-92 .
The US 101 uses three engines , while the VH-92 has two .
To some extent , the details of all the security measures incorporated in the helicopter fleet are so sensitive that it is impossible for outsiders to analyze each company 's offerings against the Pentagon 's requirements , said Loren B. Thompson , a military industry analyst at the Lexington Institute , a northern Virginia research group that monitors government spending . ''
The government will never release to the public a list of the requirements for this craft , '' Mr. Thompson said . ''
We 'll all be in the dark .
We wo n't know much because it is all classified . ''
This is the second big blow to Sikorsky .
Last year , it lost a $ 39 billion Pentagon contract when the Comanche helicopter program was cancelled . ''
Sikorsky and our All-American supplier team are disappointed with this outcome , '' said Stephen N. Finger , Sikorsky 's president . ''
We 're honored to have flown U.S. presidents for nearly half a century . ''
Sikorsky is perhaps best known as maker of the Black Hawk helicopter , a military war horse that is in heavy use in Iraq .
The VH-92 offering being designed by Sikorsky is a variant of its new S-92 midsized helicopter that the company is making with international partners .
The fact that the VH-92 could trace its lineage to a foreign design caused some on the Lockheed side to claim that Sikorsky was not playing fair by calling its craft all-American .
At the Sikorsky plant in Stratford , the Pentagon decision was greeted glumly .
Workers gathered to commiserate at the Masters bar in nearby Shelton , where Sandi Stroomer , whose brother works at Sikorsky , as did her father , called the Pentagon decision a blow . ''
We 're a Sikorsky family from way back , '' she said .
Pat Stroomer , Sandi and Bill 's mother , chalked the loss up to politics . ''
It 's a known fact , '' she said , '' that Kerry carried Connecticut . ''
In his 2002 book , '' The Paradox of American Power , '' Joseph S. Nye Jr. , the scholar and former Pentagon official , famously distinguishes between '' hard '' and '' soft '' power .
The first is the power to coerce , largely through military might ; the second , the power to co-opt through such '' intangible '' factors as culture , values and institutions ( the media , churches , schools and so forth ) .
In an era of globalized information , Nye observes , the power to persuade has become almost as important as the power to compel , and he criticizes American policy makers for their single-minded focus on brute force .
Where , in this taxonomy , do we put the images we saw in recent weeks of United States Navy helicopter pilots aboard the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln ferrying supplies to victims of the tsunami in the Indonesian province of Aceh ?
Is that hard power with a human face ?
Soft power in a flak jacket ?
Whatever it is , it produces an inherently attractive narrative .
I arrived in Indonesia 11 days after the disaster hit , and in that day 's Jakarta Post , the capital 's chief English-language daily , I read a long and reverent profile of the American pilots bearing the headline , '' U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln Enjoys Aceh Humanitarian Mission . ''
As the Bush administration tries to blunt the hostility fostered by four years of swaggering belligerence , it should think about reconfiguring Nye 's parlor-game-cum-political-theory to its own purposes .
We know all too well that this administration does not do soft .
Nye himself once told me Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld 's response to the concept : '' I do n't know what ` soft power ' is . ''
President Bush 's chintzy initial response to the tsunami implies that he does n't know quite what it is either .
The problem with the hard-soft dichotomy itself is that it fails to take account of the soft-power potential of military helicopters and aircraft carriers .
We live in an era not only of globalized information but also of the nearly $ 450 billion defense budget .
The United States military is now an instrument of absolutely everything -- warfare , diplomacy , social policy , humanitarianism .
It just depends how we deploy it .
The critical attributes that make the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln an instrument of persuasion rather than of coercion are , first , that it is being put to nonlethal use and , second and no less important , that it is advancing humanitarian ends -- that it is not directly serving American self-interest . ''
This was an act of God , '' the Jakarta Post reporter quotes an American serviceman . ''
We are here and happy to help . ''
Soft power , in short , need not be squishy soft .
And this hard-jacketed form of persuasion may actually be more effective than the classic instruments of soft power , at least as they are embodied in popular culture .
Nye argues that , whatever its flaws , our culture projects the core values of '' democracy , personal freedom , upward mobility and openness . ''
Well , maybe that 's the subtext of '' The Day After Tomorrow '' and '' The Apprentice , '' but you could make at least as good a case that our coarse entertainment products have proved even more frighteningly hegemonic than our military .
Of course we should have exchange programs and American libraries abroad and all the other tools of public diplomacy .
But it will not be easy for even the best expressions of American culture to escape the overwhelming suspicion that now dogs all things American .
The same is true , naturally , of humanitarian helicopter missions .
But at least these are acts , with an unambiguously positive outcome .
And the use of our immense hard power for soft purposes has the additional benefit of humanizing the fierce image inevitably projected by that power : the same military that shocks and awes can also save and heal .
This is n't true for only our Armed Forces .
Consider the example of Singapore , a tiny country with a small but professional military .
While the little Seahawks flying off the deck of the Abraham Lincoln carried modest loads , six giant Chinooks , provided by the Singapore Armed Forces with little fanfare , did a good deal of the heavy lifting : when a cargo plane ran into a water buffalo and blocked the landing strip at Banda Aceh , it was a Chinook that lowered the earth-moving machinery that shoved the plane out of the way .
Singapore is , by tradition , a hard-power country , though its stature is not military but economic ( which Nye recognizes as a third , autonomous dimension of power ) .
When I stopped off there on my way home , a friend said to me , '' The irony is that Lee Kuan Yew would never have done this . ''
The tough-minded former prime minister thought , like Donald Rumsfeld seems to think , that charitable gestures were for sissies .
But Lee 's very new successor , Lee Hsien Loong , has publicly committed Singapore to the task of rehabilitating the region .
The United States will never win as much gratitude as feisty little Singapore .
And in the age of global terrorism , our soldiers must always be prepared to fight .
At the moment , in fact , the war in Iraq has put a huge strain on our forces .
But reducing that commitment will make other choices possible .
The need to respond to another epic disaster will not , God willing , come along for a good many years ; if we are to continue to deploy our hard-power resources in soft-power settings , it will mostly take the more familiar form of peacekeeping .
President Bush arrived in office so profoundly opposed to peacekeeping that he scarcely bothered with post-conflict planning in Iraq .
He has , however , lived to rue that decision .
And he has not withdrawn American peacekeepers from the ongoing NATO operation in Kosovo .
Of course , you ca n't get much publicity value from an operation scarcely anyone knows about .
And in any case peacekeepers ca n't cure what ails Kosovo in the way that air-dropped medical supplies can solve the immediate problems of Aceh .
But I would n't simply dismiss the soft-power virtues of peacekeeping .
Last year I spent a day on patrol with the American contingent in Kosovo .
I had been told that the Americans never unshouldered their weapons , doffed their wraparound sunglasses , broke formation and so on .
And yet the squad leader , Staff Sgt. Mike Chirdon , a 32-year-old carpenter from Altoona , Pa. , passed an hour teaching an impromptu civics class in a school he regularly visited and then hung out in a cafe to glean intelligence from the locals .
Neither the Italian nor the French soldiers I also spent time with had anything like the relationship with ordinary people that Chirdon had ; he was a wildly popular figure .
It occurred to me that peacekeeping might be something to which Americans -- or at least the citizen-soldier reservists who are expected to fulfill these tasks -- might be peculiarly suited .
Chirdon certainly had no doubt about the value of the work . ''
I do n't know how there could be a better mission in the world than this , '' he said .
The world is going to be seeing a lot of the American military in the coming years .
Should n't we want people -- including the American people -- to see our soldiers without their guns or their body armor , to see that they have faces and even feelings ?
Is n't that worth the price of peacekeeping entanglements ?
Call me crazy , but I think people like Mike Chirdon constitute a more precious international currency than '' Desperate Housewives . ''
THE WAY WE LIVE NOW : 1-30-05 : IDEA LAB James Traub , a contributing writer for the magazine , is at work on a book about the United Nations .
DIANA COSTALES , a collector of vintage clothing , loves to describe a find at an estate sale shortly after she moved to Albuquerque seven years ago : five women 's suits from the 1940 's -- '' some very dressy , some pretty casual , '' she said . ''
But what was so amazing about them was they were all perfect , hanging in dry-cleaner bags , '' Ms. Costales added . ''
There was n't a button missing , not a thread pulled , not a stain .
It was like time forgot them . ''
Hard to forget , however , was the price : just $ 2 apiece . ''
Half of it 's the hunt , and the other half 's finding that really great deal , '' said Ms. Costales , a stay-at-home mother and manager of investment property .
These days , the growing popularity of collecting and wearing vintage clothing has made those $ 2 deals harder to come by , as shoppers become as knowledgeable about top designers as retailers and wholesalers . ''
Some vintage shop owners , if they 're going to the same estate sales , wo n't share information because you , the shopper , are their competition , '' said Ms. Costales , who gave the $ 2 suits to her older sister .
The business of vintage clothing has changed considerably since the late 1960 's , when small shops popped up to accommodate young buyers looking for fashion alternatives , said Doris Raymond , the owner of The Way We Wore , a store in Los Angeles .
When she opened her first store , in 1981 in San Francisco , most people who wore vintage clothes bought them at thrift shops , which often received donations from estates .
The treasures and the ordinary from those donations all went to the thrift shops ' racks .
Now , many thrift shops have specialists who pull out the best offerings before they hit the floor . ''
I have not been in a thrift shop in probably eight years , '' Ms. Raymond said . ''
I rely on people who find the good stuff , so they come to me with 300 things to choose from that have been picked with quality in mind . ''
Not all old garments qualify as vintage clothing worth buying .
Ms. Raymond says the term befits clothing that symbolizes an entire decade or era , like Audrey Hepburn 's classic sheath dress by Givenchy from the 1950 's , or the Chanel look championed by Jackie Kennedy in the 60 's .
Patrick Michael Hughes , who teaches a course on the cultural history of clothing at the Parsons School of Design in New York , said vintage clothing was revered and desired for one reason . ''
It really comes down to silhouette -- primarily the shape and look -- that is very , very conscious of the body and of construction , '' he said , citing the cut of a jacket 's shoulder or sleeve . ''
It 's rooted in a vocabulary that today 's clothing is not . ''
Mr. Hughes says the collectible articles of the future will still be from top designers -- like Dior , Valentino , Balenciaga , Yves Saint Laurent and Halston .
Louis Webre , vice president for marketing and media at Doyle New York , an auction house , said that over the last four years , more people were participating in its spring and fall '' Couture , Textiles and Accessories '' auctions , which include vintage clothing .
The event that steered vintage couture sales in a new direction , creating a huge upswing in auction attendance , he said , was the 2001 Academy Awards .
Julia Roberts attended the ceremonies in a vintage Valentino dress , while Renée Zellweger arrived in a canary yellow chiffon number , circa 1960 , by Jean Desses .
A stylist had bought the Desses dress at a Doyle auction for a bid '' in the four figures , '' although Mr. Webre said that vintage couture '' can cost you well into the five figures . ''
Rachel Zoe Rosenzweig , a Los Angeles stylist , found a one-shouldered orange Valentino dress from the 1970 's that Jennifer Garner , one of her clients , wore to the 2004 Academy Awards . ''
For some actresses , high-end vintage evokes an idea of old Hollywood , because their idols and fashion icons were wearing those very designers these celebrities want to wear now , '' Ms. Rosenzweig said .
Sometimes , she noted , these gowns are on loan from the archives of designers .
But actresses often buy their own gowns from high-end vintage boutiques .
The clothing , she added , does n't have to be expensive . ''
I have gotten evening gowns for myself and my clients that have been under $ 100 that look as if they cost several thousand dollars -- but they do n't have a designer name in them , '' she said .
Some stores tend to carry only designer names .
Resurrection , a vintage clothing retailer with stores in Los Angeles and Lower Manhattan , was recently the benefactor of Norma Kamali 's entire archive from the late 1960 's through the 90 's . ''
We sold hundreds of pieces of Norma Kamali , way beyond our expectations , '' said Katy Rodriguez , the store 's co-owner .
The prices ranged from $ 150 into the thousands .
On the other hand , Foley & Corinna , a Lower East Side vintage retailer , prefers items costing $ 100 or less . ''
You 'll walk into a party , you 'll be the only one wearing the top and , if you spill a glass of wine on it , you wo n't be heartbroken , '' said Anna Corinna , a co-owner .
Andrea Linett , creative director of Lucky , the shopping magazine , who has been a buyer of vintage clothing since high school , says that it is tough to have a eureka moment in a thrift shop without having a sense of fashion history . ''
You have to have references , '' she said .
That knowledge allows thrift-store shoppers to spot signature styles of designers .
Without that knowledge , she said , a shopper may be better off going to a retailer that has already edited down the stock .
SOME people buy vintage clothing for its investment potential , but the mystique holds sway for many .
Victoria Moran , author of '' Younger by the Day : 365 Ways to Rejuvenate Your Body and Revitalize Your Spirit '' ( HarperSanFrancisco , 2004 ) , cherishes a gift she received from her mother : a 1964 jacketed summer dress by Diane von Furstenberg . ''
There is something about the way it moves , '' she said . ''
It has a bias-cut skirt .
It fits like second skin .
I wear it in the summer when I feel it 's necessary to light up a room . ''
For Ms. Moran , vintage clothing plays up womanliness , rather than girlishness , an assessment with which Katherine Sansone , a longtime vintage clothing consumer , concurs .
Ms. Sansone , owner of a public relations company in Oakland , Calif. , is also the older sister of Ms. Costales , who gave her those $ 2 suits . ''
Three are business suits , and I wear them all the time , '' she said , adding that the garments have been named according to the spirit they exude -- the '' Andrews Sisters , '' the '' Sailor , '' the '' Cocktail Hour , '' the '' Joan Crawford '' and the '' Time for Biz . '' ''
There 's a sense of elegance , sophistication and femininity about all the clothes , '' said Ms. Sansone , who still finds bargains but says the searching has become competitive because people know there is money to be made in vintage clothing . ''
When you wear them , you feel better , in the way they fit and the way they feel . ''
The '' Biz '' suit , however , is the ultimate showstopper . ''
People say that when I wear it , I have a bit more sass in my walk , '' she said . ''
And I do . ''
QUICK READ If you want to start buying women 's vintage clothing -- whether or not it comes with a designer name -- here are some considerations .
BUDGET Clothing found at estate sales may set you back only a few dollars , but garments sold at vintage boutiques may run into the hundreds and even thousands of dollars .
BODY TYPE Many vintage garments were designed in small sizes .
Try on a variety of garments in different sizes from different time periods .
Check the seams to determine whether a visit to a tailor will be worthwhile .
GARMENT CONDITION That stylish vintage frock may have more than just your name all over it : there may also be perspiration stains , fade marks and pulled threads .
Not all old garments can be successfully transformed by a visit to the dry cleaner .
SUNDAY MONEY : SPENDING Correction : February 6 , 2005 , Sunday An article last Sunday about buying vintage clothing referred incorrectly to the age of a dress attributed to the designer Diane von Furstenberg .
Ms. von Furstenberg did not emerge as a designer until 1972 , so the dress could not have been designed in 1964 ; the exact year could not be determined .
The Bush administration sought Sunday to allay concerns that a Shiite religious state could emerge in Iraq as a result of last weekend 's elections .
Speaking on television news programs on Sunday , Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said that Iraq 's most influential Shiite cleric , Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani , opposed direct cleric involvement in daily governing , and that most Iraqis rejected an Iranian-style theocracy . ''
We have a great deal of confidence in where they 're headed , '' Mr. Cheney said on '' Fox News Sunday . '' ''
I do n't think , at this stage , that there 's anything like justification for hand-wringing or concern on the part of Americans that somehow they 're going to produce a result we wo n't like . ''
He added , '' The Iraqis have watched the Iranians operate for years and create a religious theocracy that has been a dismal failure , from the standpoint of the rights of individuals . ''
In his interview , Mr. Cheney also elaborated , for the first time , on the meaning of President Bush 's challenge to the Iranian people to rise up against their ruling clerics .
In the State of the Union address , Mr. Bush said , '' As you stand for your own liberty , America stands with you . ''
Pressed to say what , exactly , the United States would do , Mr. Cheney said he and Mr. Bush '' wanted to encourage the efforts that we 've seen previously in Iran to promote freedom and democracy . ''
The statement , he said , was intended '' to encourage the reformers , if you will , inside Iran to work to build a true democracy , one that does n't vest enormous power , as this one does , in the unelected mullahs , who , we believe , are a threat to peace and stability in the region . ''
Both Mr. Cheney and Mr. Rumsfeld addressed Iran 's nuclear ambitions , with Mr. Rumsfeld saying in a CBS News interview that he thought Iran '' could be some period of years off '' from actually building a nuclear weapon .
Both men said there was still time to use diplomacy to disarm Iran , though Mr. Cheney said that if the current talks broke down , the administration would seek sanctions at the United Nations Security Council .
It was Iraq , however , and the delicate question of who will emerge in control of the country , that dominated the comments of both men .
As Shiite religious parties prepare to take power in the new national assembly , senior Shiite clerics are debating how much of the Islamic faith should be enshrined in Iraq 's new constitution , which the assembly will write .
A constitution based on Koranic law would sharply depart from the transitional law that the Americans enacted .
In one of four appearances on television news programs on Sunday , Mr. Rumsfeld echoed Mr. Cheney 's cautionary words . ''
The Shia in Iraq are Iraqis , '' Mr. Rumsfeld said on the NBC News program '' Meet the Press . '' ''
They 're not Iranians .
And the idea that they 're going to end up with a government like Iran , with a handful of mullahs controlling much of the country , I think , is unlikely . ''
But he warned that it would be '' a terrible mistake '' if the new assembly adopted a constitution that denied '' half of their population , women , the opportunity to participate fully . ''
Administration officials acknowledged that they would have much less influence over a transitional Iraqi government selected by the newly elected assembly , but were relying in part on Ayatollah Sistani 's stature to steer Iraq clear of a government led by clerics . ''
If you 're looking for guidance in terms of what the relationship is likely to be between the religious faith , Islam , and the secular side of the house , the government , you really need to look at the top cleric , Sistani , '' Mr. Cheney said . ''
He also has been very clear , from the very beginning , that he did not want to play a direct role and does n't believe clerics should play a direct role in the day-to-day operations of government . ''
As officials here monitor the election returns , Mr. Rumsfeld declined to set any schedule for withdrawing the 150,000 American troops .
He said any exit strategy would be based on conditions on the ground -- including the size of the insurgency , Syrian and Iranian help in combating it , and whether Iraqi '' fence sitters '' joined the political process -- rather than a specific date .
Mr. Rumsfeld also spelled out in greater detail than before the abilities of the 136,000 Iraqi police and military personnel that the Pentagon has said are trained and equipped .
Until recently , defense officials had given scant details on the abilities of individual Iraqi units .
Last week , Gen. Richard B. Myers , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said 40,000 of those Iraqi forces were able to handle the most challenging missions .
But Mr. Rumsfeld said Sunday that that did not mean the remaining security forces were ill-prepared . ''
Some of them are trained to be policemen , and now a policeman is not a counterterrorism , or a police commando , '' he said on CNN 's '' Late Edition . '' ''
There are about 7 or 8 or 10 different categories that are being trained to do very different things . ''
When asked about the American plans to train and advise Iraqi forces , Mr. Rumsfeld said on '' Meet the Press , '' '' The important thing to do is to see that we do not create a dependency , that we encourage them to take over that responsibility . ''
Mr. Cheney reiterated -- but this time with more definitiveness and humor in his voice -- his determination never to seek the Republican nomination for president .
Pressed on the issue by the host of '' Fox News Sunday , '' Chris Wallace , Mr. Cheney said , '' I do n't know whether you want me to take a Sherman . ''
The reference was to the Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman , who declared , '' If nominated , I will not run ; if elected , I will not serve . '' ''
That 'd be good , '' Mr. Wallace said .
Mr. Cheney then took an abbreviated Sherman , and added , '' Not only no , but hell , no . '' ''
I 've got my plans laid out , '' he said , describing rivers he has not yet fished and time he wants to spend with his grandchildren . ''
I 'm going to serve this president for the next four years , and then I 'm out of here . ''
At least 844 American service members were killed in Iraq in 2005 , nearly matching 2004 's total of 848 , according to information released by the United States government and a nonprofit organization that tracks casualties in Iraq .
The deaths of two Americans announced by the United States military on Friday -- a marine killed by gunfire in Falluja and a soldier killed by a roadside bomb in Baghdad -- brought the total killed since the war in Iraq began in March 2003 to 2,178 .
The total wounded since the war began is 15,955 .
From Jan. 1 , 2005 to Dec. 3 , 2005 , the most recent date for which numbers are available , the number of Americans military personnel wounded in Iraq was 5,557 .
The total wounded in 2004 was 7,989 .
In 2005 , the single bloodiest month for American soldiers and marines was January , when 107 were killed and nearly 500 were wounded .
At the time , American forces were conducting numerous operations to secure the country for the elections on Jan. 30 .
The second worst month was October , when 96 Americans were killed and 603 wounded .
More than half of all 2005 American military deaths , 427 , were caused by homemade bombs , most planted along roadsides and detonated as vehicles passed .
American commanders have said that roadside bombs , the leading cause of death in Iraq , have grown larger and more sophisticated .
Many are set off by remote detonators and are powerful enough to destroy heavily armored tanks and troop carriers .
The totals were compiled by Iraq Coalition Casualty Count , a nonprofit group that tracks American service members killed and wounded in Iraq .
The Associated Press , which keeps its own statistics , reported the year 's death toll as slightly lower , saying that 841 had been killed .
Death totals for Iraqis have been more difficult to estimate , and vary widely .
Iraq Body Count , an independent media-monitoring group , estimates that about 30,000 Iraqis have died since the war began in 2003 .
On Saturday , violence flared across Iraq .
In Khalis , north of Baghdad , a bomb killed five members of the Iraqi Islamic Party , a Sunni political party that defied insurgent threats and fielded candidates in the Dec. 15 election .
Since 2003 , at least 75 party members have been killed .
In central Baghdad , a roadside bomb struck an Iraqi police patrol , killing two officers .
At Camp Victory , the American military headquarters just outside Baghdad , Gen. Peter Pace , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , urged Iraqi political leaders on Saturday to form a new government as quickly as possible to avoid the kind of delay that stalled the political momentum after the vote last January . ''
Clearly , the sooner that they 're able to come to agreement on who their leaders are going to be , the sooner that those leaders then can act to appoint the rest of the country 's key leadership , '' General Pace told reporters traveling with him on a troop visit .
In historical terms , the number of casualties in Iraq is still relatively small .
At the height of the Vietnam War , the American military was sustaining 500 killed and wounded each week .
At the Battle of the Somme in 1916 , about 58,000 British soldiers were killed or wounded on the first day .
In interviews , American commanders have said the relatively unchanging number of deaths in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 belies the progress that had been made here against the guerrilla insurgency and in setting up democratic institutions .
Three nationwide votes were held this year .
Although the number of attacks against American and Iraqi forces in and around Baghdad has grown over the past year -- to about 28 per day now from about 22 a year ago -- only about 10 percent of those attacks inflict casualties , said Maj. Gen. William G. Webster Jr. , the commander of American forces in and around Baghdad .
A year ago , about 25 percent of attacks inflicted casualties .
More than 400 car and suicide bombs struck the country in 2005 , although the number has dropped sharply in recent months .
In April , for instance , there were 66 suicide and car bomb attacks , compared with 28 in November .
Correction : January 3 , 2006 , Tuesday An article on Sunday about American military casualties in Iraq misstated figures in some copies for the American service members wounded in 2005 and 2004 as reported by the Iraq Coalition Casualty Count , a nonprofit group that tracks American service members killed and wounded in Iraq .
According to the group , 5,557 American service members were wounded in 2005 , not 9,157 ; and 7,989 were wounded in 2004 , not 7,956 .
